>> Will Sentance: We'll get our thumbs and we're going to go test this out in pairing through the challenges, and then we're going to talk about why is it even possible in Java. You know a language where you do not pass functions around. This is gonna feel very, very uncomfortable.

[00:00:15]
If you had any idea of parsing a function in to another function, it's gonna feel very uncomfortable. In JavaScript, a core part of Java. We're going to see why after the pairing. But first, funds. I do not know what happened. I have some clarifications. I'm clear on this core fundamental principle of creating a function where I can take in an array and the placeholder that will then only when I call the function determine what functionality I apply to each specific element of the array.

[00:00:49]
Thumbs on this, no I don't have clarification, clear. It's good to have clarifications. A lot of thumbs up. Do wanna phrase us a question?
>> Speaker 2: I don't understand why instruction becomes functional. I bet it's just because it's a second parameter that's passed?
>> Will Sentance: It's exactly that. Damn right.

[00:01:09]
So why does a ray become one, two, three? So when we redefine the function. So with function there's two stages. This is what it will do if you use me. This is a definition. It's like if you ever use me, this is what I will do and then there's the running it.

[00:01:31]
Can you gesture which bit is the definition? Which bit of the copy around manipulate? Which version is the definition?
>> Speaker 3: I don't really understand the question.
>> Will Sentance: Lindsay, which of these is a definition?
>> Speaker 2: The top one.
>> Will Sentance: The top one, exactly, copyArrayAndManipulate. That's like this is what I'll do if you ever run me.

[00:01:52]
This is my description. This is what my functionality is. That's general, it's generic. It says, ultimately, I'm gonna run this functionality on some data, some numbers or some strings or some words or whatever and I run it on some data. But I don't yet know what that data's gonna be, because that's part of having a function.

[00:02:11]
I wanna be able to use it on lots of different types of data. So leave instead some blanks, some placeholders for that data. And then when you do run me and where am I running copyArrayandManipulate, Lindsey?
>> Speaker 2: The bottom line.
>> Will Sentance: And how do I know I'm running it?

[00:02:27]

>> Speaker 2: With the parens.
>> Will Sentance: With the parens. That's where I fill in my placeholders. So my blanks, so array is a blank I fill it in what?
>> Speaker 2: One, two, three.
>> Will Sentance: And instructions are blank, I fill it in with? And the reason is just the ordering. You will spot on is just the ordering.

[00:02:41]
Does that answer the question? Excellent, good clarification. Folks, at this point, we are going to get back to paring. Work through the challenges. Map with and for each, make sure you try and do then. I'm gonna have look at how you reach doing them and then we will talk about how is this even possible.
