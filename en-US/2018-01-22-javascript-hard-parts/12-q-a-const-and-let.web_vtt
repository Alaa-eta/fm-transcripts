00:00:00.217 --> 00:00:04.184
&gt;&gt; Will: Okay, let's have thumbs on
this function..24 Everyone's thumbs out?

2
00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:06.743
You're gonna be very disappointed in
a moment by the next function we see.

3
00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:11.968
Dave, do you wanna clarify?
&gt;&gt; Dave: Difference between

4
00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:16.715
var and let?
&gt;&gt; Will: It's essentially ES2015

5
00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:22.195
introduced us these two new ways to
declare our labels, const and let.

6
00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:26.448
The reason typically in hard parts I just
put var is because for our purposes in

7
00:00:26.448 --> 00:00:31.043
hard parts, we're not too worried, but
just know here's our fundamental rule.

8
00:00:31.043 --> 00:00:32.756
And it's not followed here, but we should.

9
00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:34.096
Here's our fundamental rule.

10
00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:38.496
We should use const for
everything, objects,

11
00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:42.130
arrays, numbers, strings, const.

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.101
Unless we know we are specifically gonna
take what data's in there right now,

13
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:50.008
the whole object, or the whole array or
the whole number, and throw it out and

14
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.375
replace it with a new object,
array or value.

15
00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.924
In which case we will use let.

16
00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:58.990
So that's the only rule,
const all the time, unless we know we

17
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.842
are absolutely gonna fully reassign
this data In which case we can use let.

18
00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:06.681
So we should probably leave it out,
but there's a debate.

19
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:09.859
We should probably leave
our output there use const.

20
00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.542
If there's a debate about
it we should use const.

21
00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.002
&gt;&gt; Dave: And then you can dig into

22
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.038
the very details.
&gt;&gt; Will: There's all sorts of

23
00:01:15.038 --> 00:01:15.954
subleties around it.

24
00:01:15.954 --> 00:01:17.475
The reason that honestly for so

25
00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:21.103
long I just use var in hard parts is
because it doesn't give us anything for

26
00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:23.927
what we're doing in our
particular areas of hard parts.

27
00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:28.096
So for now just know when you see that let
console var the next words is gonna be

28
00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:32.264
a label, and then the thing on the other
side of the = sign is gonna be the data

29
00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:33.525
stored in that label.

30
00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:34.141
Make sense, Dave?

31
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:34.641
All right.
