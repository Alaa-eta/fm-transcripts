&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Let's have
thumbs on this function.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.020
Everyone's thumbs out.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.770
You're gonna be very disappointed in
a moment by the next function we see.

4
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.861
Dave, you wanna clarify?

5
00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:13.061
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Var and let.

6
00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:16.030
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: It's essentially,

7
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.290
ES 2015 introduced us these two new ways
to declare our labels, const and let.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.220
The reason, typically in hard part,
I just used var, is because for

9
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.500
our purposes in hard part,
we're not too worried.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.201
But just know, here's our fundamental
rule, and it's not followed here but

11
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:32.774
we should.

12
00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:37.099
Here's our fundamental rule,
we should use const for

13
00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:42.184
everything, objects, arrays,
numbers, strings, const.

14
00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:46.214
Unless we know we're specifically gonna
take what data is in there right now,

15
00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:49.937
the whole object or the whole array or
the whole number and throw it out and

16
00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:52.339
replace it with a new object,
array or value.

17
00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.089
In which case we'll use let.

18
00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.884
So that's the only rule, const all
the time unless we know we're absolutely

19
00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:03.820
gonna full reassign this data,
in which case, we can use let.

20
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.932
So we should probably for
output, there's a debate.

21
00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:09.790
We should probably for
output there, use const.

22
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.929
There's a debate about it,
we should use const.

23
00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.598
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
you can dig into the, details and.

24
00:01:14.598 --> 00:01:16.574
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: There's all
sorts of subtleties around it,

25
00:01:16.574 --> 00:01:20.162
the reason that honestly, for so long, I
just use var in hard parts, is because it

26
00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:23.864
doesn't give us anything for what we're
doing in our particular areas of.

27
00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:27.918
So for now, just know,
when you see that letConsoleVar,

28
00:01:27.918 --> 00:01:30.250
the next word is gonna be a label.

29
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.773
And then the thing on the other side of
the equal sign is gonna be the date that's

30
00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:34.086
stored in that label make sense, Dave?

31
00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:35.572
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: All right,
