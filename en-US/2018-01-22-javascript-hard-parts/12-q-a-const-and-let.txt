>> Will Sentance: Let's have thumbs on this function. Everyone's thumbs out. You're gonna be very disappointed in a moment by the next function we see. Dave, you wanna clarify?
>> Speaker 2: Var and let.
>> Will Sentance: It's essentially, ES 2015 introduced us these two new ways to declare our labels, const and let.

[00:00:22]
The reason, typically in hard part, I just used var, is because for our purposes in hard part, we're not too worried. But just know, here's our fundamental rule, and it's not followed here but we should. Here's our fundamental rule, we should use const for everything, objects, arrays, numbers, strings, const.

[00:00:42]
Unless we know we're specifically gonna take what data is in there right now, the whole object or the whole array or the whole number and throw it out and replace it with a new object, array or value. In which case we'll use let. So that's the only rule, const all the time unless we know we're absolutely gonna full reassign this data, in which case, we can use let.

[00:01:03]
So we should probably for output, there's a debate. We should probably for output there, use const. There's a debate about it, we should use const.
>> Speaker 2: And you can dig into the, details and.
>> Will Sentance: There's all sorts of subtleties around it, the reason that honestly, for so long, I just use var in hard parts, is because it doesn't give us anything for what we're doing in our particular areas of.

[00:01:23]
So for now, just know, when you see that letConsoleVar, the next word is gonna be a label. And then the thing on the other side of the equal sign is gonna be the date that's stored in that label make sense, Dave?
>> Speaker 2: All right,
