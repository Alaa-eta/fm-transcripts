>> Will: Okay, let's have thumbs on this function..24 Everyone's thumbs out? You're gonna be very disappointed in a moment by the next function we see. Dave, do you wanna clarify?
>> Dave: Difference between var and let?
>> Will: It's essentially ES2015 introduced us these two new ways to declare our labels, const and let.

[00:00:22]
The reason typically in hard parts I just put var is because for our purposes in hard parts, we're not too worried, but just know here's our fundamental rule. And it's not followed here, but we should. Here's our fundamental rule. We should use const for everything, objects, arrays, numbers, strings, const.

[00:00:42]
Unless we know we are specifically gonna take what data's in there right now, the whole object, or the whole array or the whole number, and throw it out and replace it with a new object, array or value. In which case we will use let. So that's the only rule, const all the time, unless we know we are absolutely gonna fully reassign this data In which case we can use let.

[00:01:03]
So we should probably leave it out, but there's a debate. We should probably leave our output there use const. If there's a debate about it we should use const.
>> Dave: And then you can dig into the very details.
>> Will: There's all sorts of subleties around it. The reason that honestly for so long I just use var in hard parts is because it doesn't give us anything for what we're doing in our particular areas of hard parts.

[00:01:23]
So for now just know when you see that let console var the next words is gonna be a label, and then the thing on the other side of the = sign is gonna be the data stored in that label. Make sense, Dave? All right.
