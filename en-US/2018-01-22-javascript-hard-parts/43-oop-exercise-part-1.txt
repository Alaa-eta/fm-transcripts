>> Will Sentance: We are going to map through this folk, line by line as we begin to go through OOP. Andrew, what are we doing?
>> off screen male: Defining user1 as that object.
>> Will Sentance: As that object, excellent, there it is.
>> Will Sentance: Okay, now what properties are we storing on it? Andrew
>> off screen male: Theme score and increment

[00:00:25]

>> Will Sentance: Yeah, and what's the value in each? I'm really just driving this out right now Andrew, so help me out.
>> off screen male: Will, three and that function
>> Will Sentance: Yeah, notice I give myself a lower score, my friend, cause it would be pretty terrible If I gave myself a higher score than the others, that would be lame, wouldn't it?

[00:00:42]
Like self-aggrandizing score, 100. [LAUGH]
>> Will Sentance: I'll do that, and then, I changed it just before I come in. When I'm reading through I see 100, exactly. Score 100. Eddie focus. Okay Andrew you are right. Yes, we have declared the user one object there it is. Draw objects like this, with name Will, School, three and increment is what Andrew?

[00:01:26]

>> off screen male: HIgh function.
>> Will Sentance: High function definition. And we call them methods, don't we, when they're on object. Is it been called at this point? No, we just defined it. Associated the anonymous function value. the function value with the property increment. And now, we hit the next line of code.

[00:01:41]
Andrew, what's the next line of code in the global execution context tell us to do?
>> off screen male: Increment user1- [CROSSTALK]
>> Will Sentance: Yeah, let's be really precise here. I want us to be really precise here. Firstly, what does it, when it sees this line what's the first thing Josh would have to work out Andrew?

[00:02:01]

>> off screen male: Get that Object [INAUDIBLE].
>> Will Sentance: Exactly, you gotta go look for it, and see does this guy exist. Yep, there it is. And then does this incremental property exist? There it is. And does the function code. Great, there's the function. Great. So I can start creating a everyone together, a new.

[00:02:19]

>> Execution context.
>> Will Sentance: Excellent. Beautiful, such rich tones. Okay, indeed. So in we go. Core stack gets, user one dot increment. On the top of it, global just below. And we had our local memory. Okay. Now, we know we've got the increment code from the user1 function, and in here, it says user1.score++.

[00:02:56]
So there's nothing being declared in local. user1.score++, is user1 at here in local? No, it's not. So where do we look for user1 in global? Because it's next on the call stack, and what do we find? We find score, and we increment it to four. Perfect. Our fundamental goal of running a method directly on our data Encaptulated in an object that's all bundled together in one place.

[00:03:25]
Which makes our lives so easy cause I can move this object, user one, anywhere in my code and know the functionality's going to be available right on it. This is wonderful writing code to scale. We've achieved it here.
