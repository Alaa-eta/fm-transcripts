1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So,

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.270
now that we have like a real thing in
place we have a schema that we setup.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.670
We can actually try it
out with these queries.

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.148
So I'm gonna close that.

5
00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.906
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That really,

6
00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:18.750
it gets very extreme very quickly
when I try to zoom in the font.

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.148
So let's go ahead and we'll do a mutation.

8
00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:29.187
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Maybe
we'll spot mutation.

9
00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:30.510
The nice autocomplete is cool.

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.700
You don't need to give it a name, but
if you have multiple things in here,

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.720
this play button will actually let
you pick the thing you wanna run and

12
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.130
it only can do that if
you give things names.

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.620
So that's the only reason
I'm giving this one a name.

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.289
And that's actually gonna call
the createGrudge mutation.

15
00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.860
And that takes an input, so
I color my numbers right now.

16
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.741
And so that'll take an ID,
I'm just gonna give it 123.

17
00:00:57.647 --> 00:01:04.673
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [SOUND], and we'll say
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: For this joke app,

18
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:08.508
I'm not really angry at anyone,
it's really hard to come up with examples.

19
00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:25.879
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [SOUND] Does the Cool Aid
man have a name, does anyone know?

20
00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:33.715
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and then so
when that thing is created,

21
00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:35.970
we can say just what we
wanna get back from this.

22
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.160
Like I said, I want the ID, and
just the ID and the person, right?

23
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.400
You could get everything if you wanted to,
I'm just trying to make an example.

24
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.330
So we'll hit Play, and
it put that in our database.

25
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.090
Right, this is legit in that
DynamoDB table right now.

26
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.555
So we can actually try out different
mutations, put stuff in the database,

27
00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:57.640
query for stuff, and
kind of get a handle on things.

28
00:02:10.748 --> 00:02:14.251
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So this case,
we'll put maybe just the deed and

29
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:16.275
we'll put the person too.

30
00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:17.735
We'll run that one, all right.

31
00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:20.891
So now I've got two of them in there, but
I only got what I asked for in this case.

32
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:21.520
Steve Kinney: Right.

33
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.646
I said hey, create that one, give me
back the ID, give me back the deed and

34
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:26.390
the person.

35
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.020
I even got it in the order that I
asked it for which is pretty cool.

36
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.810
Let's go ahead and let's actually,
now that we have two of them in there,

37
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.820
let's actually get one and then we'll go
ahead and get another one in a second.

38
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.190
So, let's go ahead and we'll say,
query, we'll give it a name.

39
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.010
This could literally be
sandwich if you wanted it to.

40
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.580
It's just a name to identify it with.

41
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.160
What really matters is
the actual name of the query.

42
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.150
I've tended to keep them the same.

43
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.295
So the first one I made was 123.

44
00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:55.505
And we'll just say person is
all we want out of there.

45
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.037
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, and if I change
this one to 456 and I just want the deed.

46
00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:10.628
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Alright, so

47
00:03:10.628 --> 00:03:13.240
there's a great way to make a really
flexible API for the client.

48
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.410
Right, you basically say what you need,

49
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.930
what format you need it in and graphql
will figure out how to get that to you.

50
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.577
The pagination is built in there,
we can actually take a look at that too.

51
00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:31.972
Let's say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: query GetAllOfTheGrudges.

52
00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:37.358
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: listGrudges.

53
00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:41.540
ListGrudges actually has two things
that it returns, items, right?

54
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.350
Which was defined in there,
which was all the things.

55
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.060
And then that next token.

56
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.450
We'll put a few more things in there in
a little bit and we'll try it out, but

57
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.025
we'll just start out with give me items
and that's an array of all the grudges.

58
00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:59.441
So out of that array,
just get me all the person fields.

59
00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:05.426
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So you can see
it'll get you the items array and

60
00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:07.830
it's just gonna give you the persons.

61
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.410
So if you just wanted
the list of people and

62
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.380
not necessarily the deeds,
you can query for that.

63
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.633
If you want person and deed.

64
00:04:18.388 --> 00:04:19.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now you get a person and
deed.

65
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.320
The other thing is this is all being
stored in the dynamo DB database that

66
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.080
we made.

67
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.740
By we made I mean I hit a button at
one point and there was a database.

68
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.510
This is all being legit stored in
the database and it all works for free.

69
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.099
I'm gonna add just one more
thing to the database.

70
00:04:51.372 --> 00:04:54.002
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Anyone angry right now?

71
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.220
Anyone got some like childhood
repressed things going on?

72
00:04:58.805 --> 00:05:02.821
Wow we're all a bunch of really
chilled out peaceful people here.

73
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:07.540
Should have been a gratitude journal
would have been better in this case.

74
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.430
What?
Minnesota as a whole?

75
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.750
We don't have a grudge on
Minnesota we're just very.

76
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

77
00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:25.790
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just in

78
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.090
case people can't hear John, I want for
anyone watching this in the future

79
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.185
this is all of John's idea and
he's from Minnesota.

80
00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:37.630
[LAUGH] I'm from New Jersey and actually
typed this and I'm taking his suggestion.

81
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.025
I did notice, when I was in Denver and I
was getting on the air line train, it was,

82
00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:48.896
You are holding the train up!

83
00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:51.790
Please step inside, versus when I
got on the Minnesota one it was, For

84
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.640
your safety, please step in
at your earliest convenience.

85
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.450
I’m like, this is awesome.

86
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.300
So, put that in there.

87
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.610
That’s enough in the database
to make my point.

88
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.125
So what we'll do is we'll say
listGrudges and we'll give it a first 2.

89
00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:14.366
And if we just say first 2,
you're going to get the first 2,

90
00:06:14.366 --> 00:06:20.090
I'm just going to make this solely person,
right?

91
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.928
If I say first 2 but
I also ask for that next token

92
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.348
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll get the first two,

93
00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.966
and then I get this gnarly string.

94
00:06:36.057 --> 00:06:39.481
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's unique,
gotta give it that.

95
00:06:39.481 --> 00:06:45.886
And we'll say after
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

96
00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:48.720
get me two more after for the first two.

97
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.490
We're only gonna get one, obviously.

98
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.965
We'll get Minnesota, the entire state.

99
00:06:53.965 --> 00:06:55.570
And there's a next token of null.

100
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.180
So it gives you like automatic pagination.

101
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.300
We know there's no more records to show.

102
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:06.020
And that's all just kind of like built
in free which is super, super cool.

103
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.520
So, we've played with this
in this little playground.

104
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.721
It would be cool to kinda
pull it into the Grudges app.

105
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:19.348
And, we'll actually see that it's fairly
simple to do in a very trivial way.
