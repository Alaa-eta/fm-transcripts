[00:00:00]
>> Steve Kinney: So, now that we have like a real thing in place we have a schema that we setup. We can actually try it out with these queries. So I'm gonna close that.
>> Steve Kinney: That really, it gets very extreme very quickly when I try to zoom in the font.

[00:00:20]
So let's go ahead and we'll do a mutation.
>> Steve Kinney: Maybe we'll spot mutation. The nice autocomplete is cool. You don't need to give it a name, but if you have multiple things in here, this play button will actually let you pick the thing you wanna run and it only can do that if you give things names.

[00:00:40]
So that's the only reason I'm giving this one a name. And that's actually gonna call the createGrudge mutation. And that takes an input, so I color my numbers right now. And so that'll take an ID, I'm just gonna give it 123.
>> Steve Kinney: [SOUND], and we'll say
>> Steve Kinney: For this joke app, I'm not really angry at anyone, it's really hard to come up with examples.

[00:01:22]

>> Steve Kinney: [SOUND] Does the Cool Aid man have a name, does anyone know?
>> Steve Kinney: Cool, and then so when that thing is created, we can say just what we wanna get back from this. Like I said, I want the ID, and just the ID and the person, right? You could get everything if you wanted to, I'm just trying to make an example.

[00:01:42]
So we'll hit Play, and it put that in our database. Right, this is legit in that DynamoDB table right now. So we can actually try out different mutations, put stuff in the database, query for stuff, and kind of get a handle on things.
>> Steve Kinney: So this case, we'll put maybe just the deed and we'll put the person too.

[00:02:16]
We'll run that one, all right. So now I've got two of them in there, but I only got what I asked for in this case. Steve Kinney: Right. I said hey, create that one, give me back the ID, give me back the deed and the person. I even got it in the order that I asked it for which is pretty cool.

[00:02:30]
Let's go ahead and let's actually, now that we have two of them in there, let's actually get one and then we'll go ahead and get another one in a second. So, let's go ahead and we'll say, query, we'll give it a name. This could literally be sandwich if you wanted it to.

[00:02:42]
It's just a name to identify it with. What really matters is the actual name of the query. I've tended to keep them the same. So the first one I made was 123. And we'll just say person is all we want out of there.
>> Steve Kinney: Right, and if I change this one to 456 and I just want the deed.

[00:03:10]

>> Steve Kinney: Alright, so there's a great way to make a really flexible API for the client. Right, you basically say what you need, what format you need it in and graphql will figure out how to get that to you. The pagination is built in there, we can actually take a look at that too.

[00:03:24]
Let's say,
>> Steve Kinney: query GetAllOfTheGrudges.
>> Steve Kinney: listGrudges. ListGrudges actually has two things that it returns, items, right? Which was defined in there, which was all the things. And then that next token. We'll put a few more things in there in a little bit and we'll try it out, but we'll just start out with give me items and that's an array of all the grudges.

[00:03:55]
So out of that array, just get me all the person fields.
>> Steve Kinney: So you can see it'll get you the items array and it's just gonna give you the persons. So if you just wanted the list of people and not necessarily the deeds, you can query for that.

[00:04:11]
If you want person and deed.
>> Steve Kinney: Now you get a person and deed. The other thing is this is all being stored in the dynamo DB database that we made. By we made I mean I hit a button at one point and there was a database. This is all being legit stored in the database and it all works for free.

[00:04:37]
I'm gonna add just one more thing to the database.
>> Steve Kinney: Anyone angry right now? Anyone got some like childhood repressed things going on? Wow we're all a bunch of really chilled out peaceful people here. Should have been a gratitude journal would have been better in this case. What?

[00:05:11]
Minnesota as a whole? We don't have a grudge on Minnesota we're just very.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah.
>> Steve Kinney: [LAUGH]
>> Steve Kinney: Just in case people can't hear John, I want for anyone watching this in the future this is all of John's idea and he's from Minnesota. [LAUGH] I'm from New Jersey and actually typed this and I'm taking his suggestion.

[00:05:41]
I did notice, when I was in Denver and I was getting on the air line train, it was, You are holding the train up! Please step inside, versus when I got on the Minnesota one it was, For your safety, please step in at your earliest convenience. I’m like, this is awesome.

[00:05:56]
So, put that in there. That’s enough in the database to make my point. So what we'll do is we'll say listGrudges and we'll give it a first 2. And if we just say first 2, you're going to get the first 2, I'm just going to make this solely person, right?

[00:06:20]
If I say first 2 but I also ask for that next token
>> Steve Kinney: I'll get the first two, and then I get this gnarly string.
>> Steve Kinney: It's unique, gotta give it that. And we'll say after
>> Steve Kinney: So get me two more after for the first two. We're only gonna get one, obviously.

[00:06:50]
We'll get Minnesota, the entire state. And there's a next token of null. So it gives you like automatic pagination. We know there's no more records to show. And that's all just kind of like built in free which is super, super cool. So, we've played with this in this little playground.

[00:07:12]
It would be cool to kinda pull it into the Grudges app. And, we'll actually see that it's fairly simple to do in a very trivial way.
