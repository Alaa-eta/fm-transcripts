00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.032
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In this particular course,
we're gonna need to go over various

2
00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:09.846
different modules of how to integrate
different things with React,

3
00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:14.221
how to test React,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other things that are kind

4
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.354
of building around
the ecosystem with React.

5
00:00:17.354 --> 00:00:20.900
There's a previous course on this so
we go over the introduction to React.

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.464
And we're going to use the application
that we built in the introduction to React

7
00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:29.520
in this course to do things like
integrate Redux, how to build Preact.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.350
But the nice thing about
this particular course,

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.230
you don't really have to understand
the previous application to understand how

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.340
this is gonna work.

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.118
And if you wanna skip around, all these
modules are gonna be self contained.

12
00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:43.579
So we're gonna start with,

13
00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.052
if you got to bit.ly/react-v4,

14
00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:52.245
it's gonna take you to this page.

15
00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:56.166
The first 12 are done in
the previous course, right?

16
00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:01.491
And then we're gonna do
13 through 20 today.

17
00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:04.702
As a reminder, these are my teacher's
notes here so if you fall behind or

18
00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:06.809
you wanna see exactly
what I'm talking about or

19
00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:10.196
you just wanna share these with other
people, these notes are open source.

20
00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:13.254
They're meant to be shared with everyone,
right?

21
00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:14.295
So I'm super grateful for

22
00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:17.099
Frontend Masters for allowing me to
open source all these materials.

23
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.430
So if you wanna look at testing,

24
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.680
these are literally the notes
that I'm going over here.

25
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.600
It's actually what I had this
little surface for right here.

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.274
That's what I'm referring to.

27
00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:32.095
So you can see these code snippets,
you can see all that kind of stuff here.

28
00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:33.049
Cool?

29
00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:40.239
Cool, so let's go ahead and go clone our
repo here, so I'm gonna go over here.

30
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:45.311
I'm gonna clone our repo right here
in the complete intro to React v4,

31
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.434
copy that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

32
00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:52.790
I'm gonna go here to clear.

33
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.274
And I'm going to git clone blah,

34
00:01:57.274 --> 00:02:01.715
nope.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, I have it but

35
00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:04.456
I'm gonna remove it and
git clone it again.

36
00:02:10.222 --> 00:02:11.555
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So on a separate note,

37
00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:15.488
if you want to see my complete
results after I finish these things,

38
00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:19.590
there's a bunch of branches
here that already exist, right?

39
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.610
So for example, we're about to do testing
and if you click on this testing branch

40
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.220
right here, this will be the complete
testing solution, right?

41
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.571
And again, I will point that out
the end of each module as well,

42
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:32.773
you can come in here and

43
00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:37.811
you can see that the test already exists.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So each one of

44
00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:42.751
the various sections has its own branch.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

45
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.728
to show you just to how to
do it with git very quickly,

46
00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:50.139
I'm gonna go into the recently
cloned complete-intro-to-react-v4.

47
00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.318
If I wanted to clone
the existing testing branch,

48
00:02:54.318 --> 00:03:01.152
I'm gonna say git fetch testing
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry,

49
00:03:01.152 --> 00:03:05.873
git fetch origin testing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

50
00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:10.431
I fetched it and now I'm gonna say,
git checkout testing.

51
00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:18.045
And now if you look, I have this commit
right here that added the tests, okay?

52
00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:21.000
So that's how you do that.

53
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.414
Then I'm gonna start back on
master git checkout master.

54
00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:28.699
You can see here I have the last
commit here was number 9,

55
00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:34.066
which is exactly where we wanna be.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

56
00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:37.030
now we're gonna talk
about testing right now.

57
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.546
Who's excited about testing?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: People

58
00:03:41.546 --> 00:03:42.568
are actually excited about testing.

59
00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:43.235
Good for you.

60
00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:47.044
[LAUGH] So I will talk first
about testing and then I will

61
00:03:47.044 --> 00:03:51.795
give you my diatribe afterwards of
how I feel about testing React.

62
00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:53.450
But let's talk about how to do it first.

63
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.275
So the very first thing I want to tell you
is that there is a thorough testing course

64
00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:01.254
already on React from Kent C Dodds.

65
00:04:01.254 --> 00:04:03.894
It's exhaustive and exhausting.

66
00:04:03.894 --> 00:04:05.815
I'm just kidding.
It's good.

67
00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:08.341
But it goes onto everything
on how to test React.

68
00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:12.544
So if you wanna get really in-depth on how
to test React, go check out that course.

69
00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.419
And I have a link there
in the course notes for

70
00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.936
you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

71
00:04:17.936 --> 00:04:20.839
first thing is we're going to use Jest.

72
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.288
You can use Jasmine,
you can use Mocha, you can use Tape,

73
00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:26.761
you can use AVA, any one of these is fine.

74
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:30.880
I choose to use Jest, one,
because I'm just comfortable with it.

75
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.517
I've been using it for a long time and

76
00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:37.782
it has some convenience
functions that we'll talk about.

77
00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:41.790
So the first thing we're gonna do into our
project that we've recently cloned here,

78
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.967
clone the application.

79
00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:46.966
You have to do npm install, which will go
out and install all the dependencies which

80
00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:51.810
are coming from the package.json.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you don't have Node

81
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.500
installed already,
you will also have to do that.

82
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.904
If you do not already,
you will have to go and sign up for

83
00:04:59.904 --> 00:05:06.271
a Petfinder API account,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which,

84
00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:11.569
let's see, I have a link to
that inside the course notes

85
00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.685
that is going to be inside of,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here,

86
00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:18.970
inside of the state and lifecycle methods.

87
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.365
So number 6,
click on this link right here.

88
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.432
It takes you to this pet adoption thing.

89
00:05:26.432 --> 00:05:30.538
You will have to sign up for it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you're

90
00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:34.130
not in the United States, you do have to
sign up with a United States zip code.

91
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.972
You can use mine which is 98103,
which is in Seatle.

92
00:05:40.972 --> 00:05:43.621
And you should get an API key here and

93
00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:48.115
an API secret.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Don't use mine

94
00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:51.289
because after this course,
I'm going to get new ones.

95
00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.629
[LAUGH] I wrote and read it long enough
that is if you show secrets that people

96
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.790
are going to eventually use them.

97
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.671
So go set up for your own and
we'll build a pet adoption up.

98
00:06:02.671 --> 00:06:08.230
So what I want you to do is copy
this commenter application,

99
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:15.123
make a new file, and save that under
the root directory of your project and

100
00:06:15.123 --> 00:06:19.682
call it .env.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

101
00:06:19.682 --> 00:06:23.234
use the dot, that's fine, and
we're gonna have two entries in this.

102
00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:26.738
API_KEY, all caps equals blah.

103
00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:29.249
And the secret, we'll copy that as well.

104
00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:34.554
I'll have API_SECRET equals blah.

105
00:06:34.554 --> 00:06:36.821
If you took the previous
version of this course,

106
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:38.657
you don't have to do any of this stuff.

107
00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:41.372
You can just continue on with
adult application that you have.

108
00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:44.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,

109
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.110
you might have to restart your server now,

110
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.638
npm run dev.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Should start a lot

111
00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:56.584
faster this time.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because I ran this and

112
00:06:56.584 --> 00:07:00.604
I had a cache and a dist, it's actually
reading that out of the cache and

113
00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:02.958
it's assuming that it's not changing.

114
00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.876
So I think if we remove that and then say,

115
00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:11.939
npm run dev again.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Should

116
00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.949
be working, that's the hope.

117
00:07:20.493 --> 00:07:23.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, that's all to it.

118
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.976
If I put dog and Alaskan Malamute,
I'm gonna submit that.

119
00:07:28.976 --> 00:07:33.314
You'll see that I've searched for
Alaskan Malamutes in Seattle,

120
00:07:33.314 --> 00:07:35.225
which there are a lot of them.

121
00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:39.907
Because a lot of people in Seattle
have huskies and malamutes and

122
00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:44.447
all that kind of stuff.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so

123
00:07:44.447 --> 00:07:47.300
that gets us what this application can do.

124
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.181
You can click up here and
it'll take you to the search page.

125
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:51.664
You can click here,
it'll take you back to the homepage.

126
00:07:51.664 --> 00:07:56.629
So if you click on one of these,
it'll take you to the details page.

127
00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:02.473
You can click adopt here,
it'll say Yes or No, but It doesn't work.

128
00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:06.933
[LAUGH] We just did that to
demonstrate how to do a modal.
