[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: In this particular course, we're gonna need to go over various different modules of how to integrate different things with React, how to test React,
>> Brian Holt: Other things that are kind of building around the ecosystem with React. There's a previous course on this so we go over the introduction to React.

[00:00:20]
And we're going to use the application that we built in the introduction to React in this course to do things like integrate Redux, how to build Preact. But the nice thing about this particular course, you don't really have to understand the previous application to understand how this is gonna work.

[00:00:35]
And if you wanna skip around, all these modules are gonna be self contained. So we're gonna start with, if you got to bit.ly/react-v4, it's gonna take you to this page. The first 12 are done in the previous course, right? And then we're gonna do 13 through 20 today.

[00:01:01]
As a reminder, these are my teacher's notes here so if you fall behind or you wanna see exactly what I'm talking about or you just wanna share these with other people, these notes are open source. They're meant to be shared with everyone, right? So I'm super grateful for Frontend Masters for allowing me to open source all these materials.

[00:01:19]
So if you wanna look at testing, these are literally the notes that I'm going over here. It's actually what I had this little surface for right here. That's what I'm referring to. So you can see these code snippets, you can see all that kind of stuff here. Cool?

[00:01:33]
Cool, so let's go ahead and go clone our repo here, so I'm gonna go over here. I'm gonna clone our repo right here in the complete intro to React v4, copy that.
>> Brian Holt: And I'm gonna go here to clear. And I'm going to git clone blah, nope.
>> Brian Holt: Well, I have it but I'm gonna remove it and git clone it again.

[00:02:10]

>> Brian Holt: So on a separate note, if you want to see my complete results after I finish these things, there's a bunch of branches here that already exist, right? So for example, we're about to do testing and if you click on this testing branch right here, this will be the complete testing solution, right?

[00:02:28]
And again, I will point that out the end of each module as well, you can come in here and you can see that the test already exists.
>> Brian Holt: So each one of the various sections has its own branch.
>> Brian Holt: And to show you just to how to do it with git very quickly, I'm gonna go into the recently cloned complete-intro-to-react-v4.

[00:02:50]
If I wanted to clone the existing testing branch, I'm gonna say git fetch testing
>> Brian Holt: Sorry, git fetch origin testing.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, I fetched it and now I'm gonna say, git checkout testing. And now if you look, I have this commit right here that added the tests, okay?

[00:03:18]
So that's how you do that. Then I'm gonna start back on master git checkout master. You can see here I have the last commit here was number 9, which is exactly where we wanna be.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, now we're gonna talk about testing right now. Who's excited about testing?

[00:03:41]

>> Brian Holt: People are actually excited about testing. Good for you. [LAUGH] So I will talk first about testing and then I will give you my diatribe afterwards of how I feel about testing React. But let's talk about how to do it first. So the very first thing I want to tell you is that there is a thorough testing course already on React from Kent C Dodds.

[00:04:01]
It's exhaustive and exhausting. I'm just kidding. It's good. But it goes onto everything on how to test React. So if you wanna get really in-depth on how to test React, go check out that course. And I have a link there in the course notes for you.
>> Brian Holt: So first thing is we're going to use Jest.

[00:04:20]
You can use Jasmine, you can use Mocha, you can use Tape, you can use AVA, any one of these is fine. I choose to use Jest, one, because I'm just comfortable with it. I've been using it for a long time and it has some convenience functions that we'll talk about.

[00:04:37]
So the first thing we're gonna do into our project that we've recently cloned here, clone the application. You have to do npm install, which will go out and install all the dependencies which are coming from the package.json.
>> Brian Holt: If you don't have Node installed already, you will also have to do that.

[00:04:55]
If you do not already, you will have to go and sign up for a Petfinder API account,
>> Brian Holt: Which, let's see, I have a link to that inside the course notes that is going to be inside of,
>> Brian Holt: Here, inside of the state and lifecycle methods. So number 6, click on this link right here.

[00:05:23]
It takes you to this pet adoption thing. You will have to sign up for it.
>> Brian Holt: If you're not in the United States, you do have to sign up with a United States zip code. You can use mine which is 98103, which is in Seatle. And you should get an API key here and an API secret.

[00:05:47]

>> Brian Holt: Don't use mine because after this course, I'm going to get new ones. [LAUGH] I wrote and read it long enough that is if you show secrets that people are going to eventually use them. So go set up for your own and we'll build a pet adoption up.

[00:06:02]
So what I want you to do is copy this commenter application, make a new file, and save that under the root directory of your project and call it .env.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, use the dot, that's fine, and we're gonna have two entries in this. API_KEY, all caps equals blah.

[00:06:26]
And the secret, we'll copy that as well. I'll have API_SECRET equals blah. If you took the previous version of this course, you don't have to do any of this stuff. You can just continue on with adult application that you have.
>> Brian Holt: So now, you might have to restart your server now, npm run dev.

[00:06:51]

>> Brian Holt: Should start a lot faster this time.
>> Brian Holt: Because I ran this and I had a cache and a dist, it's actually reading that out of the cache and it's assuming that it's not changing. So I think if we remove that and then say, npm run dev again.

[00:07:11]

>> Brian Holt: Should be working, that's the hope.
>> Brian Holt: Cool, that's all to it. If I put dog and Alaskan Malamute, I'm gonna submit that. You'll see that I've searched for Alaskan Malamutes in Seattle, which there are a lot of them. Because a lot of people in Seattle have huskies and malamutes and all that kind of stuff.

[00:07:43]

>> Brian Holt: Cool, so that gets us what this application can do. You can click up here and it'll take you to the search page. You can click here, it'll take you back to the homepage. So if you click on one of these, it'll take you to the details page.

[00:07:56]
You can click adopt here, it'll say Yes or No, but It doesn't work. [LAUGH] We just did that to demonstrate how to do a modal.
