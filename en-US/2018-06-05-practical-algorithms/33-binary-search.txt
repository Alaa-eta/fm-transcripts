[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we're gonna talk about binary search. Again, binary search is our search where we are expecting our way to be sorted and we are going to break our list in half every time. And we're gonna say is our value that we're searching for less than or greater than this current location.

[00:00:17]
So if it's less we're gonna go to the left. If it's greater than, we're gonna go to the right. All right, what does this look like in reality? All right, so, we can do the calls that came with this. Let me go and find one, all right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: My goodness, this is a mess.

[00:00:49]
All right, so we are going to delete all that. And, so we just called our binary search with these values. I'm gonna keep them up here for a reference. So we're initializing a minimum, our maximum is list length minus one, which is one, two, three, four, five, which is four.

[00:01:14]
Initializing, a guess, that's gonna be empty. So while the minimum is less than the max, right? So why we aren't looping outside of the bounds of our function. We are going to grab the center. So our guess is, let's just start in the middle. And this is common for divide and conquer algorithm.

[00:01:38]
We start in the middle, but if you take a look at quick sort which we won't have time to cover today. It's not always gonna be in the middle. Sometimes you'll pick a point to do a divide and conquer at the end in the case of quick sort, but there's different implementations.

[00:01:55]
However, you can kind of reason that if it's divide and conquer, you'll probably gonna split in the middle, although sometimes that's not the case. Okay, so we're splitting in the middle. So if, so let's say min+max, so that's 5 / 2 is 2.5. You're gonna floor it so that's 2.

[00:02:16]
So that's 2, so list at guess. So if list at guest, which is 2, is the item, we're going to return that index. Again, we're returning the index of where we find it. Okay, so let's see, our index is 2. 012 we're so close but not quite. So we didn't met the condition, so we're gonna hop into the else.

[00:02:48]
So if the list of guess, so that's 7, is less than the item. Then lets increment the min by 1, so let's see. What is the current item? Our item is 90, is 7 less than 90? Yes, so we're going to increment our guess by 1.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Or sorry, our min by 1 2 3, otherwise, we're going to look on the other side.

[00:03:26]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: This is driving me a little bit crazy, I can't fix it right now, I don't have time, okay, so
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Great, so we need to, so our min is now 3, okay? You saw how we got that here? So now we're going to loop here again. So is min less than max?

[00:03:51]
Is 3 less than 5? Yes, great, so let's add our min and max, and we're gonna chop it in 2. Where does that bring us? To 4, so now, our center is 4. So, in the middle of that is the fourth item in the list equal our item.

[00:04:13]
So zero, one, two, three, did we do it wrong? zero, one, two, three, maybe, yeah, nope, we're just gotta keep going. So, the fourth one, so we overshot it this time. And then, we're gonna say if we found it. Great, let's return it, but we didn't. So is it less?

[00:04:47]
No, it's not. So we're going to subtract it instead. So our max is guess -1. So what's guess? 4, so now we're back at 3, and then we're gonna do this again. Hold on, are you guys checking my math?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we go,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Hm?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so it was 4, our max but min is still 3, okay, we're good.

[00:05:25]
So our max is now 3, and so 3+3, we're gonna divide it by 2. So now we're back at 3. I think we're off by 1 somewhere, are we off by 1 somewhere? Let's debug this.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so let's start from the beginning, shall we?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we're going to,

[00:06:00]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we're initializing min as 0. This is list.length and there's one, one, two, three, four, five, four. Maybe that's what I did wrong, we'll see. Yes, that's what I did wrong. We had it off by one error, okay, off by one error, sorry guys. It's just because I don't, I didn't subtract this correctly in my head.

[00:06:23]
Okay, so is min less than or equal to the max? Sure is, and then now our guess is going to be the second index, okay? So did we find it? Zero, one, two, no we didn't. So we're gonna go into this else, is 7 less than 90, yes.

[00:06:47]
So we'are going to increment our min now to 1. And then we are going to loop back into our while. So is 1 less than or equal to max? Sure is, so now we are going to map that floor, 5 / 2. So we're kind of like narrowing the

[00:07:20]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Range that we're looking in, okay. So then, that is going to be 2.math.floor, 5/2, 2.5 2.math.floor.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Let's just double check, let me just double check this.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Brutal, yeah, it is 2, that's what I thought. Okay, so we keep getting back to where we started.
>> Speaker 2: Why is that not okay?

[00:08:03]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Maybe it is fine, zero, one, two three, maybe it's fine. It's not how I think about it in my head, but maybe it's fine. Okay, so we're back at two, did we find it? No, otherwise we are going to, so is 7 less than 90? Yes, then we increment it again, so now this is 2.

[00:08:28]
Okay, then 2+4=6, so now this is 3. So is zero, one, two, three, then we find it, okay? Then we find it and we return it. We did it, there it is, any questions about this?
>> Speaker 3: If you were dealing with a larger array instead of incrementing or lowering your guess by 1, you'd want to add the array length divided by 2.

[00:09:05]
And each time you'd [CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You can do it that way. So if, so you could just divide the length, so you can divide the length or you can just choose an index in the middle and compare your item to the index in the middle. And say, is it greater than or is it less than?

[00:09:28]
And then you can change your starting index to the one after it. So, your minimum, so say your index, you are looking for something that's in the right of your array. So it's gonna be greater than your min-index. You can just set your min-index to that current one.

[00:09:52]
So then, the min and then you can just look in the left. That's another way of doing it, yeah, cool.
