>> Bianca Gandolfo: So our first sorting exercise is implementing bubble sort. Remember, this is the sort that loops through your array and it bubbles up the highest value each time. And our first task is to implement bubble sort. So I'm gonna let you do that.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: But not really. The second task that we have for sorting is to implement merge sort.

[00:00:28]
We went though the pseudo code quite a bit. So just a reminder that we're gonna split the array in halves, and we're gonna merge them recursively. And once we hit our base case, which is a sorted list of length one, right? So we're gonna check for that base case with length is either less than two or equals equals equals 1.

However you want to do it is fine. And then that's the base case. You're going to start returning up from your recursion. And you're going to compare the arrays item by item and you're going to return that result. So this is the conquer part of the divide and conquer paradigm.
