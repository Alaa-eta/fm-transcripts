00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So our first sorting
exercise is implementing Bubblesort.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.290
Remember this is the sort that
loops through your array and

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.250
it bubbles up the highest value each time,

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.600
and our first task is to
implement Bubblesort.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.040
So I'm gonna let you do that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But not really.

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.380
The second task that we have for
sorting is to implement MergeSort.

7
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.990
We went through
the pseudocode quite a bit.

8
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.350
So just a reminder that we're gonna
split the array in halves, and

9
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.480
we're gonna merge them recursively.

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.210
And once we hit our base case, which
is a sorted list of length one, right?

11
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.200
So we're gonna check, for that base case
with length is either less than two or

12
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.780
equals equals equals one.

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.051
However you wanna do it is fine.

14
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.944
And then that's the base case and

15
00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:57.130
you're gonna start returning
up from your recursion.

16
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.050
And you're going to compare
the arrays item by item, and

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.508
you're gonna return that result.

18
00:01:03.508 --> 00:01:07.380
So this is the conquer part of
the divide and conquer paradigm.
