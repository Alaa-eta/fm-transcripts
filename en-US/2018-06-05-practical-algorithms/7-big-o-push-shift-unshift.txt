[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What about this one? So we have a list of different ways that you can greet someone in languages. What's the time complexity of push? We talked a little bit about that. Constant.
>> Speaker 2: Closest goes to the end.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm. Yep, we always just put it at the end.

[00:00:21]
Not a big deal. Other languages when you're actually doing memory allocation, this might not be a constant, but in Javascript, we can reason that this is just constant. We don't need to worry about initializing an array of a certain length and blah blah blah, and then keeping track and then expanding if it exceeds a certain length.

[00:00:40]
So we don't need to worry about anything like that, cool. So what about unshift, what does unshift do?
>> Speaker 3: Removes angles.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: It removes the-
>> Speaker 2: Lines.
>> Speaker 3: First.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: The first.
>> Speaker 2: Mm, last.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Let's check. I always get confused.
>> Speaker 4: Mm-mm. It adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array.

[00:01:02]

>> Speaker 4: Is that the first-
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So x.unshift. Well you're right, okay. It actually doesn't remove anything, it just returns the last. That's interesting.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, well
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So if this is removing the last, then it's gonna be constant time.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool. And then if we do.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: I never actually use these.

[00:01:37]
Does anyone actually use these in their real life? Shift or unshift.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So for taking the first one off the front, how does that change the time complexity of this operation?
>> Speaker 4: Linear.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm. Just like I said, we're going to, if we take the first one off then we need to shift the second one into the first, the second to the first, third to the second, fourth to the third, and then that's gonna be n number of operations, where n is the length of that array.
