>> Bianca: What about this one? So, we have a list of different ways that you can greet someone in languages.
>> Bianca: What's the time complexity of push? We talked a little bit about that constant.
>> Speaker 2: Push, it goes to the end.
>> Bianca: Mm-hm, yeah, we always just put it at the end, not a big deal.

[00:00:22]
Other languages, when you're actually doing memory allocation, this might not be a constant, but in JavaScript, we can reason that this is just a constant. We don't need to worry about initializing an array of a certain length, and blah blah blah, and then keeping track, and then expanding if it exceeds a certain length.

[00:00:40]
So, we don't need to worry about anything like that. Cool, so what about unshift, what does unshift do?
>> Speaker 2: Removes first.
>> Bianca: It removes the?
>> Speaker 2: First.
>> Bianca: First.
>> Speaker 2: First.
>> Bianca: Mm-hm, last.
>> Speaker 2: Let's check, I always get confused.
>> Bianca: It adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array, and returns the new length of the array.

[00:01:03]

>> Speaker 2: So, x-
>> Speaker 3: Isn't it shift at first?
>> Bianca: Unshift, you're right, okay. That actually doesn't remove anything, it just returns last, that's interesting.
>> Bianca: Okay, well,
>> Bianca: So, if this is really last, then it's gonna be constant time.
>> Bianca: Cool, or, and then if we do,
>> Bianca: I always get these two, I never actually use these, does anyone actually use this in their real life?

[00:01:40]
Shift or unshift?
>> Bianca: So, if we're taking the first one off the front, how does that change the time complexity of this operation?
>> Speaker 2: Linear?
>> Bianca: Mm-hm, just like I said, we were going to, if we take the first one off, then we need to shift the second one into the first.

[00:01:59]
The second to the first, or sorry, second to the first, third to the second, fourth to the third. And then, that's gonna be in number of operations, where in is the length of that array.
