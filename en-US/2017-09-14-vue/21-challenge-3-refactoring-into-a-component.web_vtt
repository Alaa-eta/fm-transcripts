&gt;&gt; Sarah: Okay, so exercise time,
you are going to take this pen here and

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.720
this pen is hard coded.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.440
It has your upcoming destinations,
it has a little SVG here.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.190
It has this H2 and it has some text,
and it's all just hard coded here.

5
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.710
But in your view instance, you have
all of these locations in an array,

6
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.940
Paris, and an image, and
then there's description.

7
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.230
And what I want you to do is actually turn

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.990
this into a component,
using what's in the instance.

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.588
So rather than writing it out and
hard coding it, we're gonna make it so

10
00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:45.382
that we can replace that data and we can
use whatever data is in our instance here.

11
00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:49.388
So it's very similar to the shop
demo we saw earlier here.

12
00:00:55.084 --> 00:00:58.520
&gt;&gt; Sarah: Going from this to this.
