00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.570
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So,
let's do an exercise really quickly.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.498
Take your component solution or
the pen, this pen exactly, and

3
00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:14.245
let me make sure that it's public.

4
00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:22.608
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And just set it up
with UCLI and do a real build process.

5
00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:26.180
So just re-factor this pin
like what I had just done for

6
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.310
you when we were live coding together,
and set this up in UCLI.

7
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.720
And if you want to you can try
to set it up in Next instead.

8
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.660
I'm not gonna make you do that if you
don't want to, but for like you know if

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.860
you're extra curious about next you can
do something like that in routing but

10
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.430
for the base excercise lets
set it up with Vue-CLI and

11
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.680
I'll give you fifteen minutes for that.

12
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a few questions,

13
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.960
what's the difference between
a Vue PWA template and Nuxt?

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.740
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Well for
a Vue PWA template, they are actually not

15
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.310
terribly compatible, because like
you saw in that Nuxt.config file,

16
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.370
we are actually having to do all
of the server side rendering.

17
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.530
SO that PWA template Is assumptive of
a completely different build process.

18
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.360
So, that PWA template is
going to do a whole bunch of

19
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.430
different type of code splitting and
stuff.

20
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.910
So, they both have code splitting.

21
00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:33.230
But, that nuxt stock config
versus that index.html file,

22
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.980
those are very, very different ways
of setting up the application.

23
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:44.140
So both of them are fast, I would say,
and viewing it, PWA is really nice.

24
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.340
But if you need server side rendering,
I would go for

25
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.220
the nuxt starter and
work with that, instead of the PWA.

26
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.950
They're different build processes.

27
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.700
They're not compatible because of
the way that they're done right now.

28
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.560
I think in the future Nuxt and
the team that made that progressive

29
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
web app page are gonna work
more closely together.

30
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.530
But at this time there's a lot that you
lose going to the PWA that Next has in it.

31
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.900
You'd have to re-setup all
of that configuration.

32
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.130
They're not really the same.

33
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Then Jacob's saying
I hear great things about Nuxt.

34
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.500
I like what you're saying.

35
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.670
However, at what point should I try to
learn it and incorporate it in a project.

36
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.540
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Actually, we're gonna
kind of address that in the next section

37
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.050
a little bit.

38
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.880
But, I think when you start setting up
an application where you need routing,

39
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.010
not, you can use view router.

40
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.880
And view router is really great.

41
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.969
I don't use view router though,
I use Nuxt for

42
00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.810
my routing because I think that
that's server side rendering and

43
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.599
the perf is kinda speak for it like after
running those test I was really kind of

44
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.570
So I would say when your project
starts developing many pages,

45
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.470
and you really want it to
be as fast as possible,

46
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.740
that's a good time to start
thinking about using next.

47
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So when you're
showing us the main menu tag, and

48
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.500
right underneath there is the next tag.

49
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.730
Are you saying that when you transition
from page to page the only thing that's

50
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.400
updated in the DOM is actually
the contents of the next tag and

51
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.140
the main menu element
actually stays there?

52
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: No, no, no.

53
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.720
It's Routing.

54
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.890
As far as I'm concerned, it is actually
routing from page to page, but

55
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.510
it just keeps it consistent.

56
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.630
And also, because it's server-side
rendered, it's really, really fast for

57
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.250
it to understand that file because
you've already brought it in before.

58
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cuz as I understand it,
nuxt Does client side routing too?

59
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.020
So when you go to a new page, it doesn't
download, it doesn't hit the server for

60
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.350
everything, it just hits the server for
some stuff, and does a partial DOM update?

61
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.400
Is that-
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah I don't know a ton

62
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.460
about the internals, but some stuff is
moving because, what, so I was gonna talk

63
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.940
about this in the animation part, but
next is incrementing to a 1.0 version,

64
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.290
right now It previously was not
quite at 1.0, it was waiting for

65
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.288
this View release that came out yesterday
in order to be able to release.

66
00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:31.079
So some stuff is updating, there's
a bunch of stuff that's getting fixed and

67
00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:35.641
updating in this new version,
so I think that there's enough

68
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:40.643
moving parts that what I would do
is when that 1.0 version lands,

69
00:04:40.643 --> 00:04:46.290
which should be in the next few weeks,
is look at the release notes for that.

70
00:04:48.615 --> 00:04:53.400
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, how did everybody
do getting the components over to Vue-CLI?

71
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.580
Kind of iffy, sort of?

72
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.700
Yes, no?

73
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.360
Everyone's [LAUGH] kind of on the brink?

74
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.790
All right, well,
we will go through animations and

75
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.500
then if people have questions during I'll
give you an afternoon break and then

76
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.290
if people have questions during that I can
come by and help people set things up.

77
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.210
In the interest of time,
we should probably keep moving,

78
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.590
because we have probably more material
than we time to even cover today.
