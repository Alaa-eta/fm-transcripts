>> Sarah Drasner: Further resources. There are just a ton of view resources out there and there a lot of really good ones. My first favourite coz we are talking about favourites all day long the Vue Docs is an incredible resource there are just tonnes and tonnes of resources in the Vue docs.

[00:00:17]
They're really, really well-written. They're written like a human being talking to you, which is really nice. So if you would like further education, and to learn more, they have all sorts of examples that I didn't go over today. The Vue Repo is also really great because you can kind of keep track of some of the things that you might care about.

[00:00:36]
You can kind of look at some of the release notes from past releases. You can see people fighting in the comment, in the issues just like any other repo advert anywhere. We've got the NUXT docs, which are also really well done and also have examples for people to use.

[00:00:52]
I think that's actually kind of really really helpful, especially for something like routing and server side rendering is to actually have examples that you can follow for particular use cases. We've got the vuex docs, also really great. I wrote that CSS tricks guide, that's about five articles that goes through view.

[00:01:12]
A lot of the demos are the same, but some of the information is not. Awesome vue is a huge repo, that's just full of tonnes of great view resources. It's got podcasts. It's got all of these, [INAUDIBLE]. A lot of the really good view materials that you're gonna need to know.

[00:01:32]
I won't even make a list like this because this has pretty much everything you'd ever need to know about view all in one place. So definitely check, I'm not even at the bottom of the page by the way. [LAUGH] There's just tons and tons of stuff. There's a quite few view newsletters, there's like four of them or something.

[00:01:52]
I just linked up one here, but if you write news letter view in twitter like a bunch of things will come up, so this is a really good view, news letter. The monterail blog, I mentioned that Damian the one who put on vue, writes a lot about vue and so the monterail blog actually has just tons of great articles about view or even just like how would I create these gutters and setters from scratch if I wasn't using vue but I wanted to do it like vue.

[00:02:19]
Got like those kinds of mental exercises that are really fun to read. There's another thing I think that's also a newsletter called vue tips. There's also the majesty of you which is an ebook that you can get online. That's really great and has a lot of good exercises for you to try out as well Thank you for coming in here and lasting the entire day full of all of this material.

[00:02:48]
I really appreciate it. Thank you for coming.
>> Speaker 2: [APPLAUSE]
>> Sarah Drasner: Mark, you said that you wanted me to cover like how the vue community kind of?
>> Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to be in the final video of the course.
>> Sarah Drasner: Okay, just go over it.
>> Speaker 2: Your perspective of the team and adoption.

[00:03:19]

>> Sarah Drasner: Yeah, totally. Adoption has kind of gone like this, especially lately. You've probably heard some of this. So recently, it was adopted by Adobe and Espresso and like a few other kind of bigger companies. It's already really well adopted in Asia. So I don't know if you're familiar with Alibaba or Weibo.

[00:03:37]
Those are like two of the biggest companies in the world. But we don't really think about them because we're from the West and we don't think about the East very much. So it has really good adoption in the East In the west it's starting to pick up steam.

[00:03:53]
I think because other frameworks like Angular funded by Google and Facebook is funded by people are looking for that comparable thing in view. But view, it's not funded by a major company n that way. It has a ton of community support. Like laravel and and gitlabs and Outlook, tons and tons of people help support Vue, but it's not backed or created by a big company.

[00:04:26]
There are debates on either side of the issue about what that means, like there are some people who are like, I'm not gonna do it unless it's backed by a big company, it's a risk. There are other people who are saying, well if Facebook decides that they need it for a different direction or they're going in a different direction, there's really nothing you can do about it.

[00:04:45]
Plus, they've got licensing that basically says that they own you if you're using like a react application I'm being I'm exaggerating a bit, but there's licensing issues that come along with big companies owning it and they're both right. Both of these sides are things to take into consideration.

[00:05:05]
Evan has said that he's not gonna quit working on it but it's not just him working on it. That's the other thing that there's a giant view core team. There's a lot of contributors from all over the place, but there's also a Viewport team. So it's not just one guy at his computer or something like that as well so that's a misconception too.

[00:05:28]
So I would say adoption among big companies it's like We are seeing trend up. But this is also if compare it to where react was at this point in its youth or whatsoever because Vue is still younger than react. They're comparable. Those two lines are very much the same.

[00:05:51]
I remember even a couple years ago being at zelo and we are like I don't know. I don't know if we can adopt react. It's, like, kind of, a risk. Like, everybody uses Angular, or like looking at width and it was not enough adoption and stuff. And now, adoption is pretty ubiquitous for react if that line all of a sudden killed or something, then I would be worried.

[00:06:14]
But I think it's actually just trending and trending up. So we'll see. But yeah, those are all good concerns. That's kinda my take on it.
