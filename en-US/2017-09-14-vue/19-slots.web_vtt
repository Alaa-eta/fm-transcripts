00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.725
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay,
slots are super exciting.

2
00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:06.824
I think slots are really really cool
way to replace content for a thing.

3
00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:10.910
And you don't have to pass things down,
you don't have to use props

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.012
to change things with slots, so
they're really really flexible.

5
00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:19.313
So if we have something like our child
area here and we have this slot.

6
00:00:19.313 --> 00:00:24.426
And then we have this p tag that
has it's a veritable slot machine,

7
00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:26.814
haha with a terrible dad joke.

8
00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:30.519
We can have this slot inside
of that component, and

9
00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.668
then inside the component
itself we actually have a tag.

10
00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:39.003
We have this is slot number one and
then we have this is slot number two,

11
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:40.631
I can put in more info too.

12
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:42.831
So if we look at these things,

13
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:47.418
these are actually what's gonna
be inserted into our slots.

14
00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:51.299
So we can use slots to populate content,
this is slot number one.

15
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.810
I'm a veritable slot machine, ha ha ha.

16
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.155
And this is slot number two,
I can put more info into.

17
00:00:56.155 --> 00:01:00.942
So if we look back at this we can see
we didn't have to pass things down from

18
00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:02.126
child to parent.

19
00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:07.103
We're actually just using the markup
itself to pass things into the slots as

20
00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:07.730
we need.

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.357
We can put as much information as we
want inside of one of these slots.

22
00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:14.969
So we can also have defaults,
I love defaults.

23
00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.541
We can have something like,

24
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.629
I'm some default text placed
right inside of our slot.

25
00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.520
So that will just stay there and

26
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.755
be the content of that slot until we
decide that we want to replace it.

27
00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:28.575
So you can also have more than one,
so let's say you

28
00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:32.916
needed a bunch of different socks for
things, then you can start naming them.

29
00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:36.996
And I would say, actually suggest that if
you're ever gonna use more than one you

30
00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.381
should start naming them.

31
00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:41.177
What would end up happening
if you had multiple slots and

32
00:01:41.177 --> 00:01:43.436
one of them had a name and
one of them didn't,

33
00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.726
is anything that was left over would
go into the slot with no name.

34
00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:50.301
But it's good to be a little bit
more precise about those things,

35
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:54.274
if you're gonna use more than one slot
I would say definitely name them.

36
00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:58.548
So here we would do something
like h1 slot is header info,

37
00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:01.353
I will populate the header info slot.

38
00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:04.909
So if we have the slot name header and
this other slot,

39
00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.955
then basically anything else
will go into that extra space.

40
00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:13.307
So we have that h1 slot header, and
I will go in the unnamed slot, and

41
00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:14.971
that will output to this.

42
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:20.679
So we have main, this is the main title,
and p I will go into the unnamed slot.

43
00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:25.091
So if we want to look at a slot's example,
we could look at this wine label maker.

44
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:28.713
We can make whatever kind of wine we want.

45
00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:35.731
So we can say Frontend Masters Wine here,
and I need an s at the end of that.

46
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.155
And I'm gonna change the font.

47
00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:42.610
And I'm gonna give it a flourish, and
maybe give it like wood grains or cards.

48
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.746
And then change the image opacity and
change the label placement, etc.

49
00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:50.746
But I can go in between
this black label and

50
00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:56.494
this white label because what's happening
here is everything inside of here,

51
00:02:56.494 --> 00:03:00.630
this is one big SVG,
everything inside of here is a slot.

52
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.482
So we're replacing all of the content
that's inside of there in the slot and

53
00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:11.616
we can change out all of the styles
based on that different change.

54
00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:17.125
So if we go look at the code
we have this component that's

55
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:22.177
called appblack and
it's got a template of black.

56
00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:27.172
And then we've got this div class
of black with a slot inside of it.

57
00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:32.291
And that slot can populate whatever
content we need or want in that place.

58
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.909
When we start working with build tools,

59
00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.914
we won't have to even wrap that div with
a class around it in order to style it.

60
00:03:39.914 --> 00:03:45.169
And I'll show you why when we
work with those scoped styles.

61
00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.616
But basically we have this
components is selected.

62
00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:53.132
Remember we talked about that special is,
and we can say selected is appblack.

63
00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:56.555
Selected is @point based on
what people are clicking.

64
00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:59.232
And we're changing out
the label color as well.

65
00:03:59.232 --> 00:04:03.396
So let's go back to the demo itself and

66
00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:09.025
open it up
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And

67
00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:13.388
in here, we've got our components,
appblack and the template is black.

68
00:04:13.388 --> 00:04:18.741
Over here, we've got this container,
we've got component is selected.

69
00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:22.307
And all of this stuff that's inside of it,
and

70
00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:26.886
these templates, or
these components are really simple.

71
00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:29.182
It's just got appblack, appwhite.

72
00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:32.353
And I can change out the styles
based on what's inside.

73
00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:35.072
So I'm using these components and

74
00:04:35.072 --> 00:04:39.017
switching them out based
on what I've selected.

75
00:04:39.017 --> 00:04:44.255
So you can see how you can dynamically
change all of the content or

76
00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:48.819
change all of the styling really,
really easily here.

77
00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:54.195
And that's based off of clicking between
those two values, like you saw here.

78
00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:59.244
So if we go back here,
we've got the component is selected,

79
00:04:59.244 --> 00:05:05.778
and in the button we're saying selected
is appblack or selected is appwhite.

80
00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:10.142
So I'm changing those two components out
but I'm not changing anything that's

81
00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:13.425
inside of it, cuz it's all going
to be inserted with a slot.
