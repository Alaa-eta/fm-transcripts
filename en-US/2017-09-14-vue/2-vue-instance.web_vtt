00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:03.553
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: The first thing that
we're gonna talk about is directives

2
00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:04.780
in data rendering.

3
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.670
If you come from an Angular background, a
lot of this stuff will be review for you.

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.910
And especially if you've worked with some
of the previous frameworks that people

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.770
were talking about earlier today.

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.800
A lot of this stuff will look familiar
to you because Vue borrows from

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.020
a lot of those other areas, but
the directives are super powerful.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.760
And so we're gonna start there, and
we're also gonna talk a little about

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.050
mustache templates and
using data in the Vue instance.

10
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.380
So, just in case somebody
skipped over the introduction,

11
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.410
because I skipped
the introduction sometimes.

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.470
Here is the Github repo again, the Vue
dev tools, and the code pen collection.

13
00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:46.870
All right, let's do an intro and
the Vue instance.

14
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.757
We're gonna do a much longer,

15
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.030
deep dive into the Vue instance
a little bit later on.

16
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.500
But for now, what I'd love for
you to see here is that in order to

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.460
create this pen,
we have here is div id app.

18
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.120
And then we have mustache templates
that say text, nice to meet Vue.

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.290
And then we've got,
in our JavaScript tag here, new Vue.

20
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.755
And the element that we're using is app,

21
00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:18.213
which establishes a relationship
with this div id=app.

22
00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:25.673
You can call that whatever you want,
I could call it robot face here and

23
00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:31.620
then robot face over here and
that would still work.

24
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.670
All of the styling fell off of it,
but you kind of get the picture.

25
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.990
Then we have this data object.

26
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.840
That data object is what we're using
in the Vue instance to manage the state

27
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.760
of the application.

28
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.020
So things that we need to adjust.

29
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.110
Part of the reactivity system,
which we're gonna delve into later on.

30
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.590
But really, all you need to know for

31
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.130
now is that this text
establishes a relationship in

32
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.740
the HTML outputted through the use
these mustache template tags.

33
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.780
And that string will then
be outputted there as well.

34
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.500
So it establishes a relationship between
those mustache tags and that Hello World.

35
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.025
And that's really all you
need in order to get going.

36
00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:20.925
If you wanted to just use Vue in
an HTML application, you could.

37
00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:24.675
You have a lot of strength when you
use a whole build process, but for

38
00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:28.875
the first part of this, I'm gonna show you
how we're gonna use it in HTML CSS and

39
00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.260
JavaScript without doing a build process.

40
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.050
Because sometimes you wanna incrementally
adopt the framework before you

41
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.700
sell yourself on the farm.

42
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.830
And yes, go on.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, just a quick question.

43
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.200
Where you're assigning the element,

44
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.880
I'm assuming that that can
be any CSS type selector?

45
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.230
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yes, it can, absolutely.

46
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.150
I typically use IDs because you
only want one instance of that.

47
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.190
But it can be anything that you like.

48
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.350
So, sometimes we incrementally
adopt frameworks.

49
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.600
Especially because not many of us are just
starting a website from scratch, right?

50
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.929
So if you need to do that,
you can do that with Vue.

51
00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.190
All right, so a light comparison.

52
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.100
One more thing I wanted to
show you in this example.

53
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.570
So if we have this Hello World,
and I open it in the debug window,

54
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.350
I can go over to my Vue inspector and
then click on this root and

55
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.680
see that text over here.

56
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.520
So if I'm looking at it in the Vue
devs tool, what I will see,

57
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.600
instead of seeing all of
the elements like you see over here,

58
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.780
that's all of the outputted elements and
built elements for the page.

59
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.430
We have in the Vue dev tools
exactly what's going on.

60
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.980
So that route is that Vue instance itself
and we see that text and the Hello World.

61
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is so cool.
