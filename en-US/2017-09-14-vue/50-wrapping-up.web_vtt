WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.070
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Further resources.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.240
There are just a ton of view resources out
there and there a lot of really good ones.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.555
My first favourite coz we
are talking about favourites all day

4
00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:15.188
long the Vue Docs is an incredible
resource there are just tonnes and

5
00:00:15.188 --> 00:00:17.540
tonnes of resources in the Vue docs.

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.220
They're really, really well-written.

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.120
They're written like a human being
talking to you, which is really nice.

8
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.160
So if you would like further education,

9
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.790
and to learn more, they have all sorts
of examples that I didn't go over today.

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.160
The Vue Repo is also really
great because you can kind of

11
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.640
keep track of some of the things
that you might care about.

12
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.760
You can kind of look at some of
the release notes from past releases.

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.660
You can see people
fighting in the comment,

14
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.780
in the issues just like any
other repo advert anywhere.

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.900
We've got the NUXT docs,

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.870
which are also really well done and
also have examples for people to use.

17
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.990
I think that's actually kind of
really really helpful, especially for

18
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.100
something like routing and
server side rendering is to actually have

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.810
examples that you can follow for
particular use cases.

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.050
We've got the vuex docs,
also really great.

21
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.720
I wrote that CSS tricks guide,

22
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.230
that's about five articles
that goes through view.

23
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.590
A lot of the demos are the same,
but some of the information is not.

24
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.543
Awesome vue is a huge repo, that's just
full of tonnes of great view resources.

25
00:01:23.543 --> 00:01:24.788
It's got podcasts.

26
00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:28.630
It's got all of these, [INAUDIBLE].

27
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.800
A lot of the really good view materials
that you're gonna need to know.

28
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.680
I won't even make a list like this because
this has pretty much everything you'd

29
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.750
ever need to know about
view all in one place.

30
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.681
So definitely check, I'm not even at
the bottom of the page by the way.

31
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:48.756
[LAUGH] There's just tons and
tons of stuff.

32
00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:52.480
There's a quite few view newsletters,
there's like four of them or something.

33
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.882
I just linked up one here, but if you
write news letter view in twitter like

34
00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:01.358
a bunch of things will come up, so
this is a really good view, news letter.

35
00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:05.649
The monterail blog, I mentioned
that Damian the one who put on vue,

36
00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.165
writes a lot about vue and so the
monterail blog actually has just tons of

37
00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:15.131
great articles about view or even just
like how would I create these gutters and

38
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:19.746
setters from scratch if I wasn't using
vue but I wanted to do it like vue.

39
00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:24.531
Got like those kinds of mental
exercises that are really fun to read.

40
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:28.500
There's another thing I think that's
also a newsletter called vue tips.

41
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.360
There's also the majesty of you which
is an ebook that you can get online.

42
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.530
That's really great and
has a lot of good exercises for

43
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.010
you to try out as well Thank you for

44
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.840
coming in here and lasting the entire
day full of all of this material.

45
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.967
I really appreciate it.

46
00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:59.611
Thank you for coming.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [APPLAUSE]

47
00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:01.185
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Mark, you said that you

48
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:04.730
wanted me to cover like how
the vue community kind of?

49
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean,

50
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.106
it doesn't have to be in
the final video of the course.

51
00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:14.690
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, just go over it.

52
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Your perspective of

53
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.510
the team and adoption.
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, totally.

54
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.330
Adoption has kind of gone like this,
especially lately.

55
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.780
You've probably heard some of this.

56
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.500
So recently, it was adopted by Adobe and
Espresso and

57
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.720
like a few other kind of bigger companies.

58
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.380
It's already really well adopted in Asia.

59
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.740
So I don't know if you're
familiar with Alibaba or Weibo.

60
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.240
Those are like two of the biggest
companies in the world.

61
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.770
But we don't really think about them
because we're from the West and

62
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.760
we don't think about the East very much.

63
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.590
So it has really good
adoption in the East In

64
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.760
the west it's starting to pick up steam.

65
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.910
I think because other frameworks
like Angular funded by Google and

66
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.790
Facebook is funded by people are looking
for that comparable thing in view.

67
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.420
But view, it's not funded by
a major company n that way.

68
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.116
It has a ton of community support.

69
00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:17.828
Like laravel and and gitlabs and Outlook,

70
00:04:17.828 --> 00:04:21.992
tons and
tons of people help support Vue, but

71
00:04:21.992 --> 00:04:26.350
it's not backed or
created by a big company.

72
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.269
There are debates on either side of
the issue about what that means,

73
00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.743
like there are some people who are like,

74
00:04:32.743 --> 00:04:36.903
I'm not gonna do it unless it's
backed by a big company, it's a risk.

75
00:04:36.903 --> 00:04:40.507
There are other people who are saying,
well if Facebook decides that they need it

76
00:04:40.507 --> 00:04:43.687
for a different direction or
they're going in a different direction,

77
00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:45.713
there's really nothing
you can do about it.

78
00:04:45.713 --> 00:04:51.302
Plus, they've got licensing that basically
says that they own you if you're using

79
00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:56.968
like a react application I'm being I'm
exaggerating a bit, but there's licensing

80
00:04:56.968 --> 00:05:02.740
issues that come along with big companies
owning it and they're both right.

81
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.790
Both of these sides are things
to take into consideration.

82
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.900
Evan has said that he's not
gonna quit working on it but

83
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.440
it's not just him working on it.

84
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.290
That's the other thing that
there's a giant view core team.

85
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.080
There's a lot of contributors
from all over the place, but

86
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.280
there's also a Viewport team.

87
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.020
So it's not just one
guy at his computer or

88
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.500
something like that as well so
that's a misconception too.

89
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.630
So I would say adoption among

90
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.920
big companies it's like
We are seeing trend up.

91
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.780
But this is also if compare it
to where react was at this point

92
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.660
in its youth or whatsoever because
Vue is still younger than react.

93
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.530
They're comparable.

94
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.360
Those two lines are very much the same.

95
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.980
I remember even a couple years ago being
at zelo and we are like I don't know.

96
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.660
I don't know if we can adopt react.

97
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.180
It's, like, kind of, a risk.

98
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.455
Like, everybody uses Angular,
or like looking at width and

99
00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:05.520
it was not enough adoption and stuff.

100
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.210
And now, adoption is pretty ubiquitous for
react if

101
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.690
that line all of a sudden killed or
something, then I would be worried.

102
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.880
But I think it's actually just
trending and trending up.

103
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.900
So we'll see.

104
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.040
But yeah, those are all good concerns.

105
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.300
That's kinda my take on it.
