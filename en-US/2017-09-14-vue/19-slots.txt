>> Sarah Drasner: Okay, slots are super exciting. I think slots are really really cool way to replace content for a thing. And you don't have to pass things down, you don't have to use props to change things with slots, so they're really really flexible. So if we have something like our child area here and we have this slot.

[00:00:19]
And then we have this p tag that has it's a veritable slot machine, haha with a terrible dad joke. We can have this slot inside of that component, and then inside the component itself we actually have a tag. We have this is slot number one and then we have this is slot number two, I can put in more info too.

[00:00:40]
So if we look at these things, these are actually what's gonna be inserted into our slots. So we can use slots to populate content, this is slot number one. I'm a veritable slot machine, ha ha ha. And this is slot number two, I can put more info into.

[00:00:56]
So if we look back at this we can see we didn't have to pass things down from child to parent. We're actually just using the markup itself to pass things into the slots as we need. We can put as much information as we want inside of one of these slots.

[00:01:12]
So we can also have defaults, I love defaults. We can have something like, I'm some default text placed right inside of our slot. So that will just stay there and be the content of that slot until we decide that we want to replace it. So you can also have more than one, so let's say you needed a bunch of different socks for things, then you can start naming them.

[00:01:32]
And I would say, actually suggest that if you're ever gonna use more than one you should start naming them. What would end up happening if you had multiple slots and one of them had a name and one of them didn't, is anything that was left over would go into the slot with no name.

[00:01:46]
But it's good to be a little bit more precise about those things, if you're gonna use more than one slot I would say definitely name them. So here we would do something like h1 slot is header info, I will populate the header info slot. So if we have the slot name header and this other slot, then basically anything else will go into that extra space.

[00:02:08]
So we have that h1 slot header, and I will go in the unnamed slot, and that will output to this. So we have main, this is the main title, and p I will go into the unnamed slot. So if we want to look at a slot's example, we could look at this wine label maker.

[00:02:25]
We can make whatever kind of wine we want. So we can say Frontend Masters Wine here, and I need an s at the end of that. And I'm gonna change the font. And I'm gonna give it a flourish, and maybe give it like wood grains or cards. And then change the image opacity and change the label placement, etc.

[00:02:47]
But I can go in between this black label and this white label because what's happening here is everything inside of here, this is one big SVG, everything inside of here is a slot. So we're replacing all of the content that's inside of there in the slot and we can change out all of the styles based on that different change.

[00:03:11]
So if we go look at the code we have this component that's called appblack and it's got a template of black. And then we've got this div class of black with a slot inside of it. And that slot can populate whatever content we need or want in that place.

[00:03:32]
When we start working with build tools, we won't have to even wrap that div with a class around it in order to style it. And I'll show you why when we work with those scoped styles. But basically we have this components is selected. Remember we talked about that special is, and we can say selected is appblack.

[00:03:53]
Selected is @point based on what people are clicking. And we're changing out the label color as well. So let's go back to the demo itself and open it up
>> Sarah Drasner: And in here, we've got our components, appblack and the template is black. Over here, we've got this container, we've got component is selected.

[00:04:18]
And all of this stuff that's inside of it, and these templates, or these components are really simple. It's just got appblack, appwhite. And I can change out the styles based on what's inside. So I'm using these components and switching them out based on what I've selected. So you can see how you can dynamically change all of the content or change all of the styling really, really easily here.

[00:04:48]
And that's based off of clicking between those two values, like you saw here. So if we go back here, we've got the component is selected, and in the button we're saying selected is appblack or selected is appwhite. So I'm changing those two components out but I'm not changing anything that's inside of it, cuz it's all going to be inserted with a slot.
