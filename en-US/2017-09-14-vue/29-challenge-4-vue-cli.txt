[00:00:01]
>> Sarah Drasner: So, let's do an exercise really quickly. Take your component solution or the pen, this pen exactly, and let me make sure that it's public.
>> Sarah Drasner: And just set it up with UCLI and do a real build process. So just re-factor this pin like what I had just done for you when we were live coding together, and set this up in UCLI.

[00:00:30]
And if you want to you can try to set it up in Next instead. I'm not gonna make you do that if you don't want to, but for like you know if you're extra curious about next you can do something like that in routing but for the base excercise lets set it up with Vue-CLI and I'll give you fifteen minutes for that.

[00:00:53]

>> Speaker 2: There's a few questions, what's the difference between a Vue PWA template and Nuxt?
>> Sarah Drasner: Well for a Vue PWA template, they are actually not terribly compatible, because like you saw in that Nuxt.config file, we are actually having to do all of the server side rendering. SO that PWA template Is assumptive of a completely different build process.

[00:01:19]
So, that PWA template is going to do a whole bunch of different type of code splitting and stuff. So, they both have code splitting. But, that nuxt stock config versus that index.html file, those are very, very different ways of setting up the application. So both of them are fast, I would say, and viewing it, PWA is really nice.

[00:01:44]
But if you need server side rendering, I would go for the nuxt starter and work with that, instead of the PWA. They're different build processes. They're not compatible because of the way that they're done right now. I think in the future Nuxt and the team that made that progressive web app page are gonna work more closely together.

[00:02:06]
But at this time there's a lot that you lose going to the PWA that Next has in it. You'd have to re-setup all of that configuration. They're not really the same.
>> Speaker 2: Then Jacob's saying I hear great things about Nuxt. I like what you're saying. However, at what point should I try to learn it and incorporate it in a project.

[00:02:30]

>> Sarah Drasner: Actually, we're gonna kind of address that in the next section a little bit. But, I think when you start setting up an application where you need routing, not, you can use view router. And view router is really great. I don't use view router though, I use Nuxt for my routing because I think that that's server side rendering and the perf is kinda speak for it like after running those test I was really kind of So I would say when your project starts developing many pages, and you really want it to be as fast as possible, that's a good time to start thinking about using next.

[00:03:12]

>> Speaker 3: So when you're showing us the main menu tag, and right underneath there is the next tag. Are you saying that when you transition from page to page the only thing that's updated in the DOM is actually the contents of the next tag and the main menu element actually stays there?

[00:03:31]

>> Sarah Drasner: No, no, no. It's Routing. As far as I'm concerned, it is actually routing from page to page, but it just keeps it consistent. And also, because it's server-side rendered, it's really, really fast for it to understand that file because you've already brought it in before.
>> Speaker 3: Cuz as I understand it, nuxt Does client side routing too?

[00:03:55]
So when you go to a new page, it doesn't download, it doesn't hit the server for everything, it just hits the server for some stuff, and does a partial DOM update? Is that-
>> Sarah Drasner: Yeah I don't know a ton about the internals, but some stuff is moving because, what, so I was gonna talk about this in the animation part, but next is incrementing to a 1.0 version, right now It previously was not quite at 1.0, it was waiting for this View release that came out yesterday in order to be able to release.

[00:04:25]
So some stuff is updating, there's a bunch of stuff that's getting fixed and updating in this new version, so I think that there's enough moving parts that what I would do is when that 1.0 version lands, which should be in the next few weeks, is look at the release notes for that.

[00:04:48]

>> Sarah Drasner: Okay, how did everybody do getting the components over to Vue-CLI? Kind of iffy, sort of? Yes, no? Everyone's [LAUGH] kind of on the brink? All right, well, we will go through animations and then if people have questions during I'll give you an afternoon break and then if people have questions during that I can come by and help people set things up.

[00:05:13]
In the interest of time, we should probably keep moving, because we have probably more material than we time to even cover today.
