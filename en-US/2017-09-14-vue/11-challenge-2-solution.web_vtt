00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.440
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so we've got
our method and we've got our computed,

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.710
let's take a look at
our solution over here.

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.920
So what you should've had,

4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.650
we already have our selected post and
things already filled out.

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.708
Then in our methods,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: We have add post,

6
00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:22.640
we're establishing a relationship in
this object between author, title, and

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.480
label with this dot new author,
this dot new title, this dot new label.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.015
You can call them whatever you want to,
those are the things that I called them.

9
00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:35.655
We have this .post,
which was an empty string.

10
00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:41.325
Or we this .post, which is sorry,
an array, that top array.

11
00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:46.072
And we're pushing this new object
that we created with all of that

12
00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:51.006
information onto that and then,
emptying out all of those things.

13
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.889
So we're giving them empty strings again,
and so

14
00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.352
that's how we are submitting that post,
if we go look at the post in the html.

15
00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:03.229
We have form@sumbit.prevent, remember I
said that we're not submitting on that

16
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.593
button click,
we're submitting on the form itself, and

17
00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:11.580
we're preventing it from refreshing
the page with that .prevent modifier.

18
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.960
And we have adPost here,

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.190
you could have called that whatever
you want in the methods there.

20
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.084
So moving on to the computed value,
we have computed filter by label,

21
00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:24.912
it's very similar to the other filter
that we created, where we have

22
00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:29.598
that regex that's making sure that that
capitalization isn't gonna be a problem.

23
00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:32.385
And then we're turning this .posts,

24
00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:37.369
remember that established a relationship
with, this posts here, so

25
00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.372
we have this .post .filter and then we're
matching to the filter that we created.

26
00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:48.325
Then if we go over to the computed,
over into the HTML,

27
00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:53.599
we have this 'select' and
we have 'V model' selected,

28
00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:59.850
so that stays pretty much the same,
and we have disabled value.

29
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.470
But then what changes here is, instead
of going post through posts, we're going

30
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.250
posts filteredByLabel, or whatever
you decided to call it in that area.

31
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.470
So that is the same name as
that filtered by label, and

32
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.630
it's filteredByLabel here as well.
