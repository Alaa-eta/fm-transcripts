00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.340
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So if we're planning,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.750
we might want to see what elements
are similar between pages.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.050
A lot of times I'll do these really dumb,
quick doodles just to plot things out.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.650
You don't have to make beautiful
story boards or anything.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.470
This actually saves me a lot of time.

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.524
I'll draw out the page really quickly.

7
00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:24.100
I say okay, well that nav is
pretty similar to this nav.

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.280
Maybe I just want to make this one thing
transition in a similar way to that

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
other thing.

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.470
And you can kind of see what
things are kind of related

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.120
between pages very quickly.

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.514
The things that need to stay constant
can live outside of the pages.

13
00:00:40.514 --> 00:00:44.374
And then in layouts/default.vue,

14
00:00:44.374 --> 00:00:48.720
I've got all of the navigation elements.

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.620
We saw this setup earlier this is
just review for how next to setup.

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.540
And we can get fancier and do something
like that demo that you saw earlier

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.290
where we've got a lot of things happening.

18
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.930
But one thing you might
notice with this demo is,

19
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.790
actually let's go to the actual demo.

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.260
I think it's called nuxt-type,
that now.sh means that

21
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.560
I'm deploying on that ZEIT Now thing that
I mentioned earlier I'm not paying for it.

22
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.670
That's, you end up getting
that URL that says .now.sh.

23
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.160
It's actually a really great deployment.

24
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.290
If you hit this next up,

25
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.530
you can see that these mountains, or
whatever they are, in the background,

26
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.480
and it's a little bit clearer to
see on your own machine probably.

27
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.180
They all have slightly
different transitions and

28
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.270
those words also have slightly
different transitions.

29
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.170
They're not transitioning
the same way every time.

30
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.370
Because they looked dumb sharing the same
transition to be totally honest.

31
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.720
Some of them were longer,

32
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.030
and having them folds didn't
necessary work right for each one.

33
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.940
So I could plug into different transitions
for each different type of thing.

34
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.450
And all of these kind of circles and

35
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.350
things that you probably can't see at the
letters there's these circles and things.

36
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.330
They all had to come in differently,
so that's really,

37
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.060
really useful to have those
different types of pace transition.

38
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.800
This is a lot of code that if you're
interested in GreenSock, we could go into,

39
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.580
but we're also really running low on time,
so I'm not going to go into it.

40
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.220
I'm also going to skip this exercise,

41
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.709
because we have two more sections
to cover and we're at 3:30.

42
00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.337
And I do wanna give you at least a little
bit of a break to kind of stretch and

43
00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:39.348
stuff, cuz so far,

44
00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:43.290
I've only given you exercises [LAUGH] and
that's not really a break.

45
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.130
So, let's use this time to
take a ten minute break and

46
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.360
we'll come back and we'll do filters and
custom directives and mix ins, and

47
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.380
then we'll go over view x
really quick at the end.

48
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.200
And if you're interested in nuxt,
you can do this on your own at home.

49
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.064
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sorry to end this wrong
