[00:00:00]
>> Sarah Drasner: All right, it's an exercise time. What I need you to do is create a calculator, and it's just gonna be simple edition. We have two number values, 3 and 8 is 11. We're adding these. And then, we also have this select that will, conditionally render based on your selection, my favorite kind of taco is blank.

[00:00:26]
So the thing that I'm gonna give you is this CodePen. All we have in the CodePen are these span tags. And you're gonna have to attach directives to these span tags. And then, we have this piece. I didn't even put that SELECT in there because I want you to get used to writing that SELECT with the V model on it.

[00:00:49]
I gave you something away. Well, you probably got that part.
>> Speaker 2: I'm getting a 404, I'm trying to go to look at it.
>> Sarah Drasner: Okay, I think it's actually.
>> Speaker 3: You click the Edit in CodePen button on [INAUDIBLE].
>> Sarah Drasner: Yeah, if click this, sorry.
>> Speaker 3: I have it, but I don't have the fork.

[00:01:07]

>> Sarah Drasner: The fork button? It's because I must have forked my own pen, sorry. Here is,
>> Sarah Drasner: That, okay, if you refresh the page, it should be there.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah.
>> Sarah Drasner: Okay, so I'm gonna give you ten minutes for this. If you feel like you need a little bit more time, I can give you a little bit more time.

[00:01:28]
But just a really quick directives exercise, okay.
