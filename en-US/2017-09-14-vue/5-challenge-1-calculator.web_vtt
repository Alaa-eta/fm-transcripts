00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.195
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
it's an exercise time.

2
00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:05.840
What I need you to do is
create a calculator, and

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.677
it's just gonna be simple edition.

4
00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:12.929
We have two number values, 3 and 8 is 11.

5
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.680
We're adding these.

6
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.750
And then, we also have this
select that will, conditionally

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.890
render based on your selection,
my favorite kind of taco is blank.

8
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.010
So the thing that I'm gonna
give you is this CodePen.

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.680
All we have in the CodePen
are these span tags.

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.570
And you're gonna have to attach
directives to these span tags.

11
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.720
And then, we have this piece.

12
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.477
I didn't even put that SELECT in there
because I want you to get used to writing

13
00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:49.804
that SELECT with the V model on it.

14
00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:51.220
I gave you something away.

15
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.769
Well, you probably got that part.

16
00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.163
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm getting a 404,
I'm trying to go to look at it.

17
00:00:55.163 --> 00:00:56.930
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay,
I think it's actually.

18
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You click the Edit
in CodePen button on [INAUDIBLE].

19
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.618
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah,
if click this, sorry.

20
00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:05.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I have it,
but I don't have the fork.

21
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.866
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: The fork button?

22
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.180
It's because I must have
forked my own pen, sorry.

23
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.725
Here is,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That,

24
00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:19.106
okay, if you refresh the page,
it should be there.

25
00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:20.541
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, so

26
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:24.665
I'm gonna give you ten minutes for this.

27
00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:26.613
If you feel like you need
a little bit more time,

28
00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:28.141
I can give you a little bit more time.

29
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:31.010
But just a really quick
directives exercise, okay.
