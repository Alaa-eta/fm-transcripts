00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.262
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so Grid item
properties, we've talked about Grid column

2
00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:11.149
start, Grid column end, Grid column,
Grid row start, Grid row end, Grid row.

3
00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.660
Did we talk about Grid area?

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.157
Yes, we did.
That's a short hand, okay.

5
00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:20.307
And then later on, we're gonna
have justify self and align self.

6
00:00:20.307 --> 00:00:25.333
Which are basically just overrides for
justify content and

7
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.960
align content, that's just for myself.

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.517
Okay, so let's place an item again.

9
00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:43.321
And then I have to remember why I,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Why I put this here,

10
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.410
what I was supposed to
cover in terms of this one.

11
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.040
I don't know.

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.500
So let's actually play with the layout.

13
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.260
So we have a Holy Grail layout, right?

14
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.310
Do you remember the Holy Grail
layout when we with FlexBox?

15
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.150
Well we can do it with Grid as well.

16
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.947
And Grid is sometimes more
appropriate way to do it.

17
00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:09.450
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So just one other thing
before I go onto that Holy Grail layout.

18
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.448
The difference basically between FlexBox
and Grid is do you see that number 4?

19
00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:17.833
How it spans two lines?

20
00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:21.937
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's no
way to do that in FlexBox.

21
00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:26.490
In FlexBox it basically goes
all the way across on one line.

22
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.550
Both of them you can change the order,
right?

23
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.180
But when you change the order in Flexbox,

24
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.410
it just basically places it
between the two cells beforehand.

25
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.010
When you change the order in Grid, you're
basically saying put this exactly here,

26
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.930
this is where I want it and everything
else is just gonna flow around it.

27
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.321
If you actually place two items in the
exact same location, that's fine in Grid.

28
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:53.330
You can actually place one
thing on top of the other.

29
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.618
So, let's go on to the Holy Grail which is

30
00:02:00.618 --> 00:02:05.671
basically you want a display Grid columns

31
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:10.304
you're gonna divide into six parts.

32
00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:14.078
One-third is gonna be between the nav and
the aside, and

33
00:02:14.078 --> 00:02:19.050
then the main article is gonna be in
the middle taking up two-thirds of it.

34
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.953
And then the rows you want
the header to be 3m's high,

35
00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:30.145
you want the content to be all
the available space that's left over.

36
00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:32.500
And you want the footer just to
be half the size of the header.

37
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.902
So that's what we're going to do.

38
00:02:38.714 --> 00:02:40.280
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We're
gonna do a little bit more.

39
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.834
We're gonna basically say the grid-row for
the header goes from the first, is,

40
00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:47.078
basically takes up the whole first row.

41
00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:49.875
Goes from the first grid line
to the second grid line, and

42
00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.750
the grid column takes up all full columns.

43
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.633
The footer is the third row and
goes to the fourth, and

44
00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:59.667
this is what would have happened anyway.

45
00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:03.640
Okay, but then what I had to
do is I had to add this style.

46
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.491
Which you never have to do in real
life because right here I displayed

47
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:09.597
the style block so it's on the page.

48
00:03:09.597 --> 00:03:11.120
So I want the style to stay at the bottom.

49
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.845
So I put it basically, give the style,
put it on the fourth row, and

50
00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:18.724
make it go all the way across.

51
00:03:18.724 --> 00:03:21.250
So we're actually gonna play with
the style and change the style.

52
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.410
Why not?

53
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.825
So let's get rid of this.

54
00:03:25.447 --> 00:03:26.120
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And there we go.

55
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.600
So what happened?

56
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.910
The header went from the first
grid line to the second grid line

57
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.010
and from the left most grid line
to the right most grid line.

58
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.879
The navigation takes
up all the free space.

59
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.446
No it doesn't.

60
00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:45.862
It takes up two thirds of it.

61
00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:50.630
And each one of these takes up one-sixth,
because we have 1fr, 4fr, 1fr.

62
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.584
What's 1 plus 4 plus 1?

63
00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:54.360
I can't do math this early in the morning.

64
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.760
Someone could count it with their toes,
no, with their fingers, that's better.

65
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.270
Keep your shoes on.

66
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.796
We want go above ten so
that we don't have to count with our toes.

67
00:04:04.796 --> 00:04:08.326
And then grid template rows,
the first one is 3 ems or

68
00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:12.890
we could change it to 4 ems or
5 ems if we want the header to be taller.

69
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.284
The middle part takes all
the available space after that,

70
00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:19.732
because the bottom part is just 1.5 ems.

71
00:04:19.732 --> 00:04:23.561
So I've declared an absolute
length on the footer and

72
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:27.219
on the header and
basically said that middle area,

73
00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.830
the article nav in the side
distributed over rows in the middle.

74
00:04:34.643 --> 00:04:39.130
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
header, footer, style.

75
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.680
Let's change the style because why not.

76
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.499
Let's just make it go from 1 to 3.

77
00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.842
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Why not?

78
00:04:50.842 --> 00:04:53.521
Let's make it go from 4 to 7.

79
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:55.340
That doesn't make a difference, right?

80
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.110
Because now, if we actually added items,
it'd be one here, one here, and one here.

81
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.270
Because it's now going across three rows,
right?

82
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.362
It's gonna take it from four to five,
five to six, and six to seven.

83
00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:12.480
But because we don't have any extra cells,
it doesn't matter.

84
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.068
If I did just,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 2 to 3.

85
00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:23.888
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And 1 to 3.

86
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.606
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then I'm going to take the nav and

87
00:05:29.606 --> 00:05:31.230
I'm going to put it in the same spot.

88
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.787
So the nav and
the style are the exact same location.

89
00:05:40.438 --> 00:05:41.423
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You can do that.

90
00:05:41.423 --> 00:05:44.849
Don't don't but you can.
