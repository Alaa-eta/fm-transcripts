00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:04.448
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
so grid item properties.

2
00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:08.592
We've talked about grid-column-start,
grid-column-end, grid-column,

3
00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:11.226
grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-row.

4
00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:12.501
Did we talk about grid-area?

5
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:13.721
Yes we did.
That's the short hand.

6
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:16.300
Okay.

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.589
And then later on,
we're going to have justify-self and

8
00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.616
align-self, which are basically
just overrides for

9
00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:28.920
justify content in align-content but
just for one cell.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.344
Okay, so let's place an item again.

11
00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:43.382
And then I have to remember why I,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Why I put this here,

12
00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:46.410
what I was supposed to
cover in terms of this one.

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.040
I don't know.

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.500
So let's actually play with the layout.

15
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.260
So we have a holy grail layout, right?

16
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.310
Do you remember the holy grail
layout when we do with the flex box?

17
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.853
Well we can do it with grid as well, and

18
00:00:56.853 --> 00:01:00.205
grid is sometimes a more
appropriate way to do it.

19
00:01:03.592 --> 00:01:09.450
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So just one other thing
before I go onto that holy grail layout.

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.890
The difference, basically,
between Flexbox and

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.890
grid is, do you see that number
4 how it spans two lines?

22
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.124
There is no way to do that in Flexbox.

23
00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:26.490
In Flexbox, it basically goes
all the way across on one line.

24
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.550
Both of them you can change the order,
right?

25
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.180
But when you change the order in Flexbox,

26
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.410
it just basically places it
between the two cells beforehand.

27
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.010
When you change the order in grid you're
basically saying put this exactly here,

28
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.930
this is where I want it, and everything
else is just gonna flow around it.

29
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.080
If you actually place two items in exact
same location, that's fine in grid.

30
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.330
You can actually place one
thing on top of the other.

31
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.660
So let's go on to the holy grail, which

32
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.420
is basically you want to display grid,
columns.

33
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.350
You're gonna divide it into six parts.

34
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.910
One third is gonna be between the nav and
the aside, and then the main area or

35
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.050
the main article, is going to be in
the middle, taking up two-thirds of it.

36
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.495
And then the rows, you want
the header to be 3m's high, you want

37
00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:30.420
the content to be all the available
space that's left over,

38
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.500
and you want the footer just to be
half the the size of the header.

39
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.893
So that's what we're going to do.

40
00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:40.280
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We're
gonna do a little bit more.

41
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.800
We're gonna basically
say that grid-row for

42
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.200
the header goes from the first,
it basically takes up the whole first row.

43
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.750
It goes from the first grid
line to the second grid line.

44
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.750
And the grid column takes
up all four columns.

45
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.290
The footer is the third row and
goes to the fourth, and

46
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.510
this is what would have happened anyway,
okay?

47
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.110
But then what I had to do was I had to add
the style, which you never have to do in

48
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.790
real life, because right here I displayed
the style block, so it's on the page.

49
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.120
So I want the style to stay at the bottom.

50
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.660
So I basically give it a style,

51
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.950
put it on the fourth row, and
make it go all the way across.

52
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.410
So we're gonna actually play with
a style and change the style, why not?

53
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.729
So let's get rid of this.

54
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.120
And there we go.

55
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.600
So what happened?

56
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.910
The header went from the first
grid line to the second grid line

57
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.010
and from the left most grid line
to the right most grid line.

58
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.033
The navigation takes
up all the free space.

59
00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:46.102
No, it doesn't,
it takes up two-thirds of it.

60
00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:49.580
And each one of these takes up
one-sixth because we have 1fr 4fr 1fr.

61
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.950
What's one plus four plus one?

62
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.360
I can't do math this early in the morning.

63
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.760
Somebody could count it with their toes,
no, with their fingers, that's better.

64
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.270
Keep your shoes on.

65
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.516
We won't go above ten, so
that we don't have to count with our toes.

66
00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:08.220
And then grid-template-rows,
the first one is 3 ems,

67
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.890
we could change it to 4 ems or
5 ems if we want the header to be taller.

68
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.030
The middle part takes all
the available space after that,

69
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.990
because the bottom part is just 1.5 ems.

70
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.020
So we've declared an absolute
length on the footer, and

71
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.810
on the header and basically said that
middle area, the article, nav and

72
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.040
aside, distributed over
rows in the middle.

73
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.130
Okay, so header, footer, style.

74
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.842
Let's change the style.

75
00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:43.511
Because why not?

76
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:45.470
Let's just make it go from 1 to 3.

77
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.650
Why not?

78
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.790
Let's make it go from 4 to 7.

79
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.340
That doesn't make a difference right?

80
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.110
Because now if we actually added items,
it'd be one here, one here, and one here.

81
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.158
Because it's now going across Three rows,
all right?

82
00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:09.479
It's going to take you from 4 to 5,
5 to 6, and 6 to 7.

83
00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.424
But because we don't have any extra cells,
it doesn't matter.

84
00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:20.156
If I did just 2 to 3,

85
00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:26.360
and 1 to 3,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

86
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.028
then I'm going to take the nav and
I'm gonna put it in the same spot.

87
00:05:33.028 --> 00:05:38.835
So the nav and
the style are the exact same location.

88
00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:42.704
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You can do that.

89
00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:44.643
Don't, don't, but you can.
