00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.783
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I would like to just add
one feature to the grids that we talked

2
00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.706
about earlier.

3
00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:09.783
I did not show you the debugging tools.

4
00:00:09.783 --> 00:00:15.530
So right now, I am in Firefox.

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.790
And hopefully,
I can make the debugger bigger.

6
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.590
I cannot.

7
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.155
Usually you go in here and
you just make it bigger.

8
00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.185
And that's making the page bigger.

9
00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.753
And.

10
00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:31.991
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Could I
possibly make this any smaller?

11
00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.310
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No, not really.

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.544
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There should be a setting,
Cmd+?

13
00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:41.852
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right,
this time it worked.

14
00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:43.269
It wasn't working before, okay.

15
00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.204
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
in the Firefox Developer Tools,

16
00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:52.017
if you actually pick
the element where the grid is,

17
00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:56.656
which is our ordered list,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

18
00:00:56.656 --> 00:01:02.530
you go down here to where you say display
grid, there's this icon right here.

19
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.364
And you can click it and
it will show you the grid lines.

20
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.580
So, Firefox actually has some
pretty neat debugging tools.

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.970
And there's features like dragging and

22
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.720
stuff like that,
which I didn't wanna go into.

23
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.890
But I just wanted to show you that in the
debugging tools there's actually ways of

24
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.660
looking at your grid and
playing around with it.

25
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.983
So, that's it for grids.
