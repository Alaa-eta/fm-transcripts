00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.182
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I would like to just
add one feature to the grids that we

2
00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:06.600
talked about earlier.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.476
I did not show you the debugging tools.

4
00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:14.660
So right now I am in Firefox

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.790
and hopefully I can make
the debugger bigger.

6
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.452
I cannot, usually you go in here and
just make it bigger and

7
00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:30.161
that's making the page bigger, and,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Could I

8
00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:31.320
possibly make this any smaller.

9
00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:35.833
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No not really.

10
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:40.049
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah it's,oh,

11
00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:41.870
this time it worked.

12
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.590
It wasn't working before, okay.

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.570
So, in the Firefox developer tools,

14
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.450
if you actually pick the element where
the grid is, which is our order list.

15
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.372
And you go down here to where it says
display grid, there's this icon right

16
00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:05.063
here and you can click it and
it will show you the grid lines.

17
00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:11.713
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So Firefox actually has
some pretty neat debugging tools and

18
00:01:11.713 --> 00:01:16.640
there's features like dragging and
stuff like that.

19
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.920
Which I didn't want to go into, but I just
wanted to show you that in the debugging

20
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.660
tools, there's actually ways of looking
at your grid and playing around with it.

21
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.829
So that's it for grids.
