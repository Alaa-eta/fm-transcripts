00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.270
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
in this example there is striping.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.750
And this is how we used to do striping
before we actually realized it's much

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.230
easier to do with repeated
linear gradients.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.230
So the reason this one works is
because it's exactly 135 degrees.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.310
And because the first
quarter of the image,

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.760
the top left corner, is transparent and
the bottom right corner is transparent.

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.420
And so it's basically the same
color is repeating, so

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.870
it's being placed on top of it.

9
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.190
If I actually change the degrees and
I don't think I can,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.260
cuz I don't think this is live.

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.111
130, yeah it is,

12
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:44.885
you see how it breaks?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

13
00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:46.370
you see how it breaks?

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.510
It's just basically cuz it's
perfectly measured to 135 degrees.

15
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.027
Much easier way to do it is to say,

16
00:00:57.027 --> 00:01:01.309
let's do a repeating linear gradient.

17
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.450
Now, it repeats, and
the last color is purple.

18
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.366
So right here you'll see
that I'm using pixels,

19
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.924
length units instead of percentages.

20
00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:21.601
Now, if I change the last one to 20%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: They would

21
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:27.625
repeat five times across the page.

22
00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:32.202
Because the last color stop the length
unit of the last color stop, whatever that

23
00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:36.530
length is, that is the width of your
gradient, that is your gradient size.

24
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.234
So here before I had it at 120 pixels.

25
00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:46.150
So each line of color
was 20 pixels wide and

26
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.730
when it reached the 120 pixel mark,
it started with the color red again.

27
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.264
So repeating linear gradients
take the exact same syntax,

28
00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:58.920
except for it says repeating in
front of the word linear gradient.

29
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.457
So it's repeating-linear-gradient
instead of linear gradient.

30
00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:09.584
You can do, to top right,

31
00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:14.951
to top left, same angles.

32
00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:20.621
45 degrees will be the same,

33
00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:23.660
degrees, right?

34
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.300
And notice if I say 0,
that's not valid, but okay.

35
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.970
I guess it did work.

36
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.080
Because that's the default.

37
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.711
So let's go back an angle,
135 degrees cuz I like that.

38
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:44.648
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This gradient is going

39
00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:48.020
from red to orange to yellow
to green to blue to purple.

40
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.820
And the last purple,
the last spot is the 120% pixel mark.

41
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.130
That means my gradient is 120
pixels wide and then it repeats.

42
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.826
So the other gradient is
basically from 0 to the 100% mark

43
00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:09.367
unless you use background size.

44
00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:14.096
So if I did actually background size,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I

45
00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:15.568
can't do that on this one.

46
00:03:15.568 --> 00:03:19.862
Let's copy this over and

47
00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:23.344
go back two slides.

48
00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:28.757
And put it in a background-image.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right,

49
00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:35.443
if I did background-size,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 120

50
00:03:35.443 --> 00:03:41.359
pixels.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Semicolon.

51
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.774
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I would start getting

52
00:03:45.774 --> 00:03:48.009
really ugly stuff.

53
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:55.981
If I did 240 pixels,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's perfect.

54
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:57.297
2400 pixels, that's why.

55
00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:01.775
240 pixels, it's still ugly, but
it's repeating twice within each gradient.

56
00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.709
You see how in this box right here,
in this background image,

57
00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.534
the size is 240 x 240.

58
00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:11.004
Let's just do background-repeat:
no repeat so I can point it out.

59
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.590
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

60
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.354
you see here there's more than two

61
00:04:22.354 --> 00:04:27.330
red lines.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And the reason there is

62
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.951
more than two red lines
is because this one gets,

63
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:36.018
it's basically there's two blue lines.

64
00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:37.682
There's two purple lines.

65
00:04:37.682 --> 00:04:38.905
But there is a little bit more room.

66
00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:40.886
It's because it's where
the radius line goes.

67
00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:44.177
If I actually did 0 degrees
there would be two of

68
00:04:44.177 --> 00:04:48.482
each.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Actually there is more

69
00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:49.537
than two of each.

70
00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:55.424
I don't know what I'm talking about.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's

71
00:04:55.424 --> 00:05:01.041
do it 90 degrees.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

72
00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:02.708
there it's exactly two.

73
00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:03.611
There's two red lines,

74
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:08.842
there's two purple lines.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: What

75
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.768
did I wanna say about this?

76
00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:16.718
But if I did percentage, right, and

77
00:05:16.718 --> 00:05:23.910
I did 50%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's the exact same.

78
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.633
But if I did 100%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Basically

79
00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:36.673
the purple goes from the 100 pixels to 240
because my background image is 240 pixels.

80
00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:41.096
And then if I did repeat it

81
00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:45.525
would actually repeat.

82
00:05:54.263 --> 00:05:55.095
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

83
00:05:55.095 --> 00:06:00.504
one other thing in gradients,
before I move on this slide is,

84
00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:04.780
you don't wanna mix
percentages with lengths.

85
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.588
Because If you mix percentages with
lengths that percentage, when I said 50%,

86
00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:12.550
if it was 240 pixels that
would have been great.

87
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.210
But what if I changed my
background size to 60 pixels?

88
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.217
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you can mix but

89
00:06:20.217 --> 00:06:24.102
it can have unintended consequences.
