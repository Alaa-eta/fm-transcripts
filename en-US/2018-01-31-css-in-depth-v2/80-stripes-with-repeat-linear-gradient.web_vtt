00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.270
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So in this example,
there is striping.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.750
And this is how we used to do striping
before we actually realized it's much

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.230
easier to do with
repeating linear gradients.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.306
So the reason this one works is
because it's exactly 135 degrees.

5
00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:22.455
And because the first quarter of
the image, the top-left corner

6
00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:27.612
is transparent, and
the bottom-right corner is transparent.

7
00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:30.447
And so it's basically the same
color is repeating, so

8
00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.870
it's being placed on top of it.

9
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.635
If I actually change the degrees,
and I don't think I can,

10
00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:39.714
cuz I don't think this is live, 130.

11
00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:42.968
Yep, it is, you see how it breaks?

12
00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:46.600
And you see how it breaks?

13
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.675
It's just basically cuz
it's perfectly measured,

14
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:51.180
&gt;&gt; Estelle: To 1,

15
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:54.650
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 135 degrees.

16
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.309
Much easier way to do it is to say
let's do a repeating linear gradient.

17
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.450
Now, it repeats and
the last color is purple.

18
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.382
So right here you'll see
that I'm using pixels length

19
00:01:12.382 --> 00:01:14.150
units instead of percentages.

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.178
Now, if I change the last one to 20%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Oop.

21
00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:25.870
&gt;&gt; Estelle: They would repeat five times

22
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.560
across the page.

23
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.180
Because the last color stop,
the length unit of the last color stop,

24
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.490
whatever that length is,
that is the width of your gradient.

25
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.426
That is your gradient size.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So here before,

26
00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:42.160
I had it at 120 pixels.

27
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.150
So each line of color was 20 pixels wide,
and

28
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.670
when it reached the 120 pixel mark,
it started again with the color red.

29
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.704
So repeating linear gradients take
the exact same syntax except for

30
00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:58.899
it says repeating in front
of the word linear-gradient.

31
00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.414
So it's repeating-linear-gradient
instead of linear-gradient.

32
00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:08.226
You can do to top right,

33
00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:12.616
to top left, same angles.

34
00:02:16.122 --> 00:02:18.958
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 45 degrees would be the same

35
00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:23.808
degrees, right?
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

36
00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:29.164
notice if I say 0,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: That's not valid,

37
00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:32.952
but okay, I guess it did work.

38
00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.863
Because that's the default.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

39
00:02:36.863 --> 00:02:40.597
let's go back to an angle,
135 degrees, because I like that.

40
00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:44.972
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: This gradient is going from

41
00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:48.020
red to orange to yellow to
green to blue to purple.

42
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.820
And the last purple,
the last spot is the 120% pixel mark.

43
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.690
That means my gradient is 120
pixels wide and then it repeats.

44
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.648
So the other gradient is basically
from 0 to the 100% mark unless you use

45
00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:09.580
background-size.

46
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.688
So if I did actually background-size,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I can't do that on this one.

47
00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:22.242
Let's copy this over,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And go back two slides and

48
00:03:22.242 --> 00:03:28.591
put a background-image.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Right?

49
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:35.502
If I did background-size,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 120

50
00:03:35.502 --> 00:03:42.102
pixels.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Semicolon.

51
00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.617
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I would start getting really

52
00:03:44.617 --> 00:03:49.852
ugly stuff.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If I did 240 pixels,

53
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.995
&gt;&gt; Estelle: It's perfect.

54
00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:59.565
2,400 pixels that's why,
240 pixels, it's still ugly, but

55
00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:01.856
it's repeating twice within each gradient.

56
00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:06.258
You see how in this box right here,
in this background image,

57
00:04:06.258 --> 00:04:08.383
the size is 240 by 240.

58
00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:11.049
Let's just do background-repeat:
no-repeat, so I can point it out.

59
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:20.684
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so you see here,

60
00:04:20.684 --> 00:04:26.881
there's more than two red lines.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

61
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:31.128
the reason there's more
than two red lines is

62
00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:35.947
because it's basically
there's two blue lines.

63
00:04:35.947 --> 00:04:38.847
There's two purple lines, but
there's a little bit more room.

64
00:04:38.847 --> 00:04:40.697
It's because of where
the radiant line goes.

65
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.611
If I actually did 0 degrees,

66
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:47.686
there would be two of each.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Actually,

67
00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:49.454
no, there's more than two of each.

68
00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:54.632
I don't know what I'm talking about.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Let's

69
00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:58.365
do it,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 90 degrees.

70
00:05:00.572 --> 00:05:02.595
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, there, it's exactly two.

71
00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:03.546
There's two red lines,

72
00:05:03.546 --> 00:05:09.526
there's two purple lines.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: What

73
00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.032
did I wanna say about this?

74
00:05:11.032 --> 00:05:14.001
But if I did percentage, right?

75
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:18.039
And I did,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 50%,

76
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.812
&gt;&gt; Estelle: It's the exact same.

77
00:05:23.812 --> 00:05:29.777
But if I did 100%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Basically,

78
00:05:29.777 --> 00:05:33.275
the purple goes from
the 100 pixels to 240,

79
00:05:33.275 --> 00:05:36.614
because my background image is 240 pixels.

80
00:05:36.614 --> 00:05:40.597
And then if I did repeat,

81
00:05:40.597 --> 00:05:44.970
it would actually repeat.

82
00:05:54.244 --> 00:05:55.093
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so

83
00:05:55.093 --> 00:06:00.090
one other thing in gradients
before I move off this slide

84
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.675
is you don't wanna mix
percentages with lengths.

85
00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:09.245
Because if you mix percentages with
lengths, that percentage when I said 50%,

86
00:06:09.245 --> 00:06:13.226
if it was 240 pixels that would've
been great, but what if I change my

87
00:06:13.226 --> 00:06:18.693
background-size to 60 pixels?
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

88
00:06:18.693 --> 00:06:23.200
you can mix, but
it can have unintended consequences.
