[00:00:02]
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so Grid item properties, we've talked about Grid column start, Grid column end, Grid column, Grid row start, Grid row end, Grid row. Did we talk about Grid area? Yes, we did. That's a short hand, okay. And then later on, we're gonna have justify self and align self.

[00:00:20]
Which are basically just overrides for justify content and align content, that's just for myself. Okay, so let's place an item again. And then I have to remember why I,
>> Estelle Weyl: Why I put this here, what I was supposed to cover in terms of this one. I don't know.

[00:00:47]
So let's actually play with the layout. So we have a Holy Grail layout, right? Do you remember the Holy Grail layout when we with FlexBox? Well we can do it with Grid as well. And Grid is sometimes more appropriate way to do it.
>> Estelle Weyl: So just one other thing before I go onto that Holy Grail layout.

[00:01:10]
The difference basically between FlexBox and Grid is do you see that number 4? How it spans two lines?
>> Estelle Weyl: There's no way to do that in FlexBox. In FlexBox it basically goes all the way across on one line. Both of them you can change the order, right? But when you change the order in Flexbox, it just basically places it between the two cells beforehand.

[00:01:35]
When you change the order in Grid, you're basically saying put this exactly here, this is where I want it and everything else is just gonna flow around it. If you actually place two items in the exact same location, that's fine in Grid. You can actually place one thing on top of the other.

[00:01:55]
So, let's go on to the Holy Grail which is basically you want a display Grid columns you're gonna divide into six parts. One-third is gonna be between the nav and the aside, and then the main article is gonna be in the middle taking up two-thirds of it. And then the rows you want the header to be 3m's high, you want the content to be all the available space that's left over.

[00:02:30]
And you want the footer just to be half the size of the header. So that's what we're going to do.
>> Estelle Weyl: We're gonna do a little bit more. We're gonna basically say the grid-row for the header goes from the first, is, basically takes up the whole first row.

[00:02:47]
Goes from the first grid line to the second grid line, and the grid column takes up all full columns. The footer is the third row and goes to the fourth, and this is what would have happened anyway. Okay, but then what I had to do is I had to add this style.

[00:03:03]
Which you never have to do in real life because right here I displayed the style block so it's on the page. So I want the style to stay at the bottom. So I put it basically, give the style, put it on the fourth row, and make it go all the way across.

[00:03:18]
So we're actually gonna play with the style and change the style. Why not? So let's get rid of this.
>> Estelle Weyl: And there we go. So what happened? The header went from the first grid line to the second grid line and from the left most grid line to the right most grid line.

[00:03:39]
The navigation takes up all the free space. No it doesn't. It takes up two thirds of it. And each one of these takes up one-sixth, because we have 1fr, 4fr, 1fr. What's 1 plus 4 plus 1? I can't do math this early in the morning. Someone could count it with their toes, no, with their fingers, that's better.

[00:03:58]
Keep your shoes on. We want go above ten so that we don't have to count with our toes. And then grid template rows, the first one is 3 ems or we could change it to 4 ems or 5 ems if we want the header to be taller. The middle part takes all the available space after that, because the bottom part is just 1.5 ems.

[00:04:19]
So I've declared an absolute length on the footer and on the header and basically said that middle area, the article nav in the side distributed over rows in the middle.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so header, footer, style. Let's change the style because why not. Let's just make it go from 1 to 3.

[00:04:48]

>> Estelle Weyl: Why not? Let's make it go from 4 to 7. That doesn't make a difference, right? Because now, if we actually added items, it'd be one here, one here, and one here. Because it's now going across three rows, right? It's gonna take it from four to five, five to six, and six to seven.

[00:05:09]
But because we don't have any extra cells, it doesn't matter. If I did just,
>> Estelle Weyl: 2 to 3.
>> Estelle Weyl: And 1 to 3.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then I'm going to take the nav and I'm going to put it in the same spot. So the nav and the style are the exact same location.

[00:05:40]

>> Estelle Weyl: You can do that. Don't don't but you can.
