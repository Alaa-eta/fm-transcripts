[00:00:02]
>> Estelle Weyl: So in this example there is striping. And this is how we used to do striping before we actually realized it's much easier to do with repeated linear gradients. So the reason this one works is because it's exactly 135 degrees. And because the first quarter of the image, the top left corner, is transparent and the bottom right corner is transparent.

[00:00:26]
And so it's basically the same color is repeating, so it's being placed on top of it. If I actually change the degrees and I don't think I can, cuz I don't think this is live. 130, yeah it is, you see how it breaks?
>> Estelle Weyl: And you see how it breaks?

[00:00:46]
It's just basically cuz it's perfectly measured to 135 degrees. Much easier way to do it is to say, let's do a repeating linear gradient. Now, it repeats, and the last color is purple. So right here you'll see that I'm using pixels, length units instead of percentages. Now, if I change the last one to 20%,

[00:01:19]

>> Estelle Weyl: They would repeat five times across the page. Because the last color stop the length unit of the last color stop, whatever that length is, that is the width of your gradient, that is your gradient size. So here before I had it at 120 pixels. So each line of color was 20 pixels wide and when it reached the 120 pixel mark, it started with the color red again.

[00:01:52]
So repeating linear gradients take the exact same syntax, except for it says repeating in front of the word linear gradient. So it's repeating-linear-gradient instead of linear gradient. You can do, to top right, to top left, same angles. 45 degrees will be the same, degrees, right? And notice if I say 0, that's not valid, but okay.

[00:02:31]
I guess it did work. Because that's the default. So let's go back an angle, 135 degrees cuz I like that. So,
>> Estelle Weyl: This gradient is going from red to orange to yellow to green to blue to purple. And the last purple, the last spot is the 120% pixel mark.

[00:02:55]
That means my gradient is 120 pixels wide and then it repeats. So the other gradient is basically from 0 to the 100% mark unless you use background size. So if I did actually background size,
>> Estelle Weyl: I can't do that on this one. Let's copy this over and go back two slides.

[00:03:23]
And put it in a background-image.
>> Estelle Weyl: Right, if I did background-size,
>> Estelle Weyl: 120 pixels.
>> Estelle Weyl: Semicolon.
>> Estelle Weyl: I would start getting really ugly stuff. If I did 240 pixels,
>> Estelle Weyl: It's perfect. 2400 pixels, that's why. 240 pixels, it's still ugly, but it's repeating twice within each gradient. You see how in this box right here, in this background image, the size is 240 x 240.

[00:04:07]
Let's just do background-repeat: no repeat so I can point it out.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so you see here there's more than two red lines.
>> Estelle Weyl: And the reason there is more than two red lines is because this one gets, it's basically there's two blue lines. There's two purple lines.

[00:04:37]
But there is a little bit more room. It's because it's where the radius line goes. If I actually did 0 degrees there would be two of each.
>> Estelle Weyl: Actually there is more than two of each. I don't know what I'm talking about.
>> Estelle Weyl: Let's do it 90 degrees.

[00:05:00]

>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, there it's exactly two. There's two red lines, there's two purple lines.
>> Estelle Weyl: What did I wanna say about this? But if I did percentage, right, and I did 50%,
>> Estelle Weyl: It's the exact same. But if I did 100%,
>> Estelle Weyl: Basically the purple goes from the 100 pixels to 240 because my background image is 240 pixels.

[00:05:36]
And then if I did repeat it would actually repeat.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so one other thing in gradients, before I move on this slide is, you don't wanna mix percentages with lengths. Because If you mix percentages with lengths that percentage, when I said 50%, if it was 240 pixels that would have been great.

[00:06:12]
But what if I changed my background size to 60 pixels?
>> Estelle Weyl: So you can mix but it can have unintended consequences.
