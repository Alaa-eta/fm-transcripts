[00:00:01]
>> Estelle: So in this example, there is striping. And this is how we used to do striping before we actually realized it's much easier to do with repeating linear gradients. So the reason this one works is because it's exactly 135 degrees. And because the first quarter of the image, the top-left corner is transparent, and the bottom-right corner is transparent.

[00:00:27]
And so it's basically the same color is repeating, so it's being placed on top of it. If I actually change the degrees, and I don't think I can, cuz I don't think this is live, 130. Yep, it is, you see how it breaks? And you see how it breaks?

[00:00:46]
It's just basically cuz it's perfectly measured,
>> Estelle: To 1,
>> Estelle: 135 degrees. Much easier way to do it is to say let's do a repeating linear gradient. Now, it repeats and the last color is purple. So right here you'll see that I'm using pixels length units instead of percentages.

[00:01:15]
Now, if I change the last one to 20%,
>> Estelle: Oop.
>> Estelle: They would repeat five times across the page. Because the last color stop, the length unit of the last color stop, whatever that length is, that is the width of your gradient. That is your gradient size.
>> Estelle: So here before, I had it at 120 pixels.

[00:01:42]
So each line of color was 20 pixels wide, and when it reached the 120 pixel mark, it started again with the color red. So repeating linear gradients take the exact same syntax except for it says repeating in front of the word linear-gradient. So it's repeating-linear-gradient instead of linear-gradient.

[00:02:04]
You can do to top right, to top left, same angles.
>> Estelle: 45 degrees would be the same degrees, right?
>> Estelle: And notice if I say 0,
>> Estelle: That's not valid, but okay, I guess it did work. Because that's the default.
>> Estelle: So let's go back to an angle, 135 degrees, because I like that.

[00:02:40]
So,
>> Estelle: This gradient is going from red to orange to yellow to green to blue to purple. And the last purple, the last spot is the 120% pixel mark. That means my gradient is 120 pixels wide and then it repeats. So the other gradient is basically from 0 to the 100% mark unless you use background-size.

[00:03:09]
So if I did actually background-size,
>> Estelle: I can't do that on this one. Let's copy this over,
>> Estelle: And go back two slides and put a background-image.
>> Estelle: Right? If I did background-size,
>> Estelle: 120 pixels.
>> Estelle: Semicolon.
>> Estelle: I would start getting really ugly stuff.
>> Estelle: If I did 240 pixels,

[00:03:53]

>> Estelle: It's perfect. 2,400 pixels that's why, 240 pixels, it's still ugly, but it's repeating twice within each gradient. You see how in this box right here, in this background image, the size is 240 by 240. Let's just do background-repeat: no-repeat, so I can point it out.
>> Estelle: Okay, so you see here, there's more than two red lines.

[00:04:26]

>> Estelle: And the reason there's more than two red lines is because it's basically there's two blue lines. There's two purple lines, but there's a little bit more room. It's because of where the radiant line goes. If I actually did 0 degrees, there would be two of each.
>> Estelle: Actually, no, there's more than two of each.

[00:04:49]
I don't know what I'm talking about.
>> Estelle: Let's do it,
>> Estelle: 90 degrees.
>> Estelle: Okay, there, it's exactly two. There's two red lines, there's two purple lines.
>> Estelle: What did I wanna say about this? But if I did percentage, right? And I did,
>> Estelle: 50%,
>> Estelle: It's the exact same.

[00:05:23]
But if I did 100%,
>> Estelle: Basically, the purple goes from the 100 pixels to 240, because my background image is 240 pixels. And then if I did repeat, it would actually repeat.
>> Estelle: Okay, so one other thing in gradients before I move off this slide is you don't wanna mix percentages with lengths.

[00:06:04]
Because if you mix percentages with lengths, that percentage when I said 50%, if it was 240 pixels that would've been great, but what if I change my background-size to 60 pixels?
>> Estelle: So you can mix, but it can have unintended consequences.
