00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.970
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Rachel Andrews who is
awesome has this website called Grid

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.550
by Example and
there's a little in it to start here and

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.190
that's where you should
start to learn the basics.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.050
You basically know the basics but

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.170
you're gonna forget everything I just told
you today cuz you're gonna have so much by

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.690
the end of the day that your brain is
going to explode, so you wanna come here.

7
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.700
And then Jen Simmons has an intro to CSS.

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.220
And it's not just an intro to CSS,
but she has all of these labs.

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.520
So when you go to her web page, I'm just
going to go to jensimons.com, here it is,

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.360
Jen Simmons.

11
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.680
There is a little thing
right here called labs.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.080
You click on labs, and
she has a monopoly done with CSS grid.

13
00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:53.045
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: She's
a great graphic designer, so

14
00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:56.099
she basically has this example here.

15
00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:04.603
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Where that is a much more
beautiful website than having everything,

16
00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:08.200
she makes very good use of white space.

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.317
And so here,
we have five images placed in a grid,

18
00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:16.155
where she basically said, this is the row
I want and this is the column I want.

19
00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:21.440
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: They're what
you call explicitly placed.

20
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.902
And then she has some artwork here,

21
00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:29.632
a responsive Mondrian here.

22
00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:36.794
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then when you
actually switch, that did not work, yeah,

23
00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:43.121
it shrank, that's not that, Fluid
Mondrian, I think that's the one, okay.

24
00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.568
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Nope,
there's one where it actually changes.

25
00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:58.868
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, so this one,
you'll see that it changes as you grow it.

26
00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.717
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So what you wanna do with
these things is you wanna take a look

27
00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:07.337
at them.

28
00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:12.586
Go wow, that's amazing,
and then do a view source,

29
00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:15.619
look at how she created it, and

30
00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:20.771
take a look at the CSS, and
go wow, that's so easy.

31
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:25.830
Grid, once you get used to it,
it makes laying out pages super easy.
