00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:06.346
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Rachel Andrews, who is
awesome, has this website called Grid by

2
00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:09.641
Example and there's a little
button that says start here and

3
00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:13.190
that's where you should
start to learn the basics.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.050
You basically know the basics but

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.830
you're gonna forget everything I just
told you today cuz you're gonna have so

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.740
much by the end of the day that
your brain is going to explode.

7
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.700
So you wanna come here, and
then Jen Simmons has an intro to CSS,

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.220
and it's not just an intro to CSS,
but she has all of these labs.

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.780
So when you go to her webpage.

10
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.360
I'm just gonna go to jensimmons.com,
here it is, Jen Simmons.

11
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.680
There's a little thing
right here called labs.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.732
You click on labs and she has like
a monopoly done with CSS grid.

13
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.158
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: She's a great graphic

14
00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:59.277
designer, so
she basically has this example here.

15
00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:04.857
Where that is a much more beautiful
website than having everything like,

16
00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:08.200
she makes very good use of white space.

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.757
And so here we have five images placed in

18
00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:14.320
a grid where she basically said
this is the row I want and

19
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.915
this is the column I want.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: They're

20
00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:23.890
what you call explicitly placed and
then she has some artwork here.

21
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.478
A responsive Mondrian,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here and

22
00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:37.060
then when you actually switch,
that did not work.

23
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.940
Yeah, it shrank.

24
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.520
It's Fluid Mondrian,
I think that's the one,

25
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.444
okay.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No, there's one where it

26
00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:57.166
actually changes.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah, so this one,

27
00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:03.304
you'll see that it changes as you grow it.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

28
00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:08.036
what you wanna do with these things
is you wanna take a look at them,

29
00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:11.696
go wow, that's amazing and
then do a view source.

30
00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:17.780
Look at she created it and take a look
at the CSS and go, wow, that's so easy.

31
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.220
Grid, once you get used to it,
makes laying out pages super easy.
