00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.060
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's go onto the direction.

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.720
Basically everything so
far has been top to bottom, except for

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.850
the ones that weren't editable
which went from left to right.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.440
So you can declare the direction.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.751
So let's first start by
discussing when you say to and

6
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:21.316
either give a side or a corner.

7
00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:28.040
So the options are to top,
to bottom and to bottom is the default,

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.490
to left, to right, to top left, to top
right, to bottom left and to bottom right.

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.630
In this example here,
this is the midpoint and

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.030
I'm gonna say to bottom,
which is the default.

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.833
And so that gradient line
goes from top to bottom.

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.700
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I say to left,
you'll see it's going from the first

13
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.126
color to cleared,
of purple, to a golden run.

14
00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:01.320
It's going from the right to the left.

15
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.820
Now, it's gonna go from
the left to the right.

16
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490
It's basically going to right.

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.890
And then I can have it go to top.

18
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.920
Fairly simple, right?

19
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.450
Now I'm gonna say to top left.

20
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.900
And if you see the midpoint
of that gradient,

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.730
right, is going from the bottom
corner to the top corner, right?

22
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.050
And the gradient line that's along,

23
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.270
like if I'd given 15 different
colors it would go along that line.

24
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.740
So everything's going along that line.

25
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.206
It's perpendicular to the midpoint.

26
00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.480
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: To top right.

27
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.460
They're called magic corners,
which is the 50% mark,

28
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.660
goes from this corner right here,
if it didn't have a border radius,

29
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.500
to this corner right here if it
didn't have a border radius.

30
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.840
And it's a little off, no it's not
actually, it's perfectly fine, okay.

31
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.950
So basically that's whats going on.

32
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.850
Your gradient line is at a right angle to

33
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.530
the midpoint of a line that goes
from one corner to the other corner.

34
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.840
So it's going from the top, in this
case it's going to the bottom right,

35
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.210
so it's starting up here and
going down here.

36
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.130
So it is going in the general
direction in the bottom right.

37
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.096
But it's going in the general direction so

38
00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:34.887
that the perpendicular line
would go from corner to corner.

39
00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:41.200
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So let's try this.

40
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.159
Just write all of them, to right,

41
00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.101
to left, to bottom right.

42
00:02:53.053 --> 00:02:56.317
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And let's just do 50%.

43
00:02:56.317 --> 00:02:59.606
50%.

44
00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:03.289
You see how that green line, that yellow,
green change goes from corner to corner?

45
00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:08.164
But the gradient line, so the gradient
line is the line that's going from red

46
00:03:08.164 --> 00:03:11.092
to orange to yellow to
green to blue to purple.

47
00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:17.905
So it's actually going from the top
left corner to the bottom right corner.

48
00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:22.459
But it's not actually hitting either
corner, it's going in such a way that it's

49
00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.551
perpendicular to the line that goes
from the bottom left to the top right,

50
00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:27.805
does that make sense?

51
00:03:32.624 --> 00:03:34.065
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
now let's discuss angles.

52
00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:37.440
So we've been declaring
everything with key terms,

53
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.816
now we can learn how to do it with angles.

54
00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:47.429
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The degrees go,
starting at 12 noon or

55
00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:51.909
at the top, which is 0%.

56
00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:58.224
The right is 90%, the bottom is 180,
and the left is 270.

57
00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:02.394
So 0 degrees is the same as top, but

58
00:04:02.394 --> 00:04:07.260
45 degrees is not the same as top right.

59
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.820
Because 45 degrees will
always be 45 degrees.

60
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.503
But top right might be at a different
angle depending on the aspect ratio.

61
00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:21.200
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
the degree is required.

62
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.150
You don't have to use degrees.

63
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.620
You can use radians or grads.

64
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.300
But no one uses radiants or grads, so
we're not really gonna cover them, but

65
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.400
you can actually play with it,
and it's fine.

66
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.824
So here, right there,
I made it 216 degrees.

67
00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:45.912
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And so the degrees is
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 0

68
00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:48.179
degrees is actually where
the black line goes, right?

69
00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:51.983
It's going 0 degrees,
it's going up and down.

70
00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:54.223
And then the gradient
follows that gradient line.

71
00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:02.145
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And so
let's just click on 45 degrees, right?

72
00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:04.580
That's 45 degrees.

73
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.520
And then let's do top right.

74
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.860
So you see, it's slightly different.

75
00:05:10.283 --> 00:05:14.420
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And just to reiterate
the point between 45 degrees.

76
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.620
The one that says 45 degrees, the angle
is, that gradient is never gonna change.

77
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.100
The box is gonna get taller or
shorter, but it's not gonna

78
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.400
change the angle whereas the top right
will actually change its location.

79
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.030
So you see, the 45 degree is that
angle is still exactly the way it was,

80
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.870
whereas the gradient line in the two
top right is almost vertical.

81
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.790
And here it's closer to horizontal,
where as this one is still 45 degrees.

82
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.170
So two top right and
45 degrees aren't actually different.

83
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.530
So one of the questions that I got was,
can you animate it?

84
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.530
And I did it once.

85
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.830
So I did this website called, The School
for Machines Who Can't Learn Good and

86
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.460
Wanna Do Other Stuff Good Too.

87
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.320
And there's two Easter eggs on this page.

88
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.436
One is the white twitch, and then the
other one is an animated radio gradient.

89
00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.865
And it doesn't animate very well.

90
00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.296
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
it is possible to animate but

91
00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:23.453
it's kind of not the best thing to do.

92
00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:28.430
So let's move on and
continue on gradients.

93
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.947
And we will actually talk about maybe
animating a gradient when we talk about

94
00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:31.706
animations later on.
