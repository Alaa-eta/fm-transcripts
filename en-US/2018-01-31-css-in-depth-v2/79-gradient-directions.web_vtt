00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.517
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So, let's go on to
the direction basically, everything so

2
00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:07.502
far has been top to bottom,
except the ones that weren't editable,

3
00:00:07.502 --> 00:00:08.850
which went from left to right.

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.440
So, you can declare the direction.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.520
So, let's first start by
discussing when you say to and

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.570
either give a side or a corner.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.040
So, the options are to top, to bottom,
and to bottom is the default.

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.517
To left, to right, to top left,
to top right, to bottom left, and

9
00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:36.817
to bottom right.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: In this example here this

10
00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:42.030
is the mid-point and I'm gonna say
to bottom which is the default.

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.081
And so that gradient line
goes from top to bottom.

12
00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:51.084
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If I say to left, you'll see

13
00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:57.886
it's going from the color
declared of purple to goldenrod.

14
00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:03.861
It's going from the right to the left.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Now

15
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:07.523
it's gonna go from the left to the right,

16
00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:12.217
it's basically going to right.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

17
00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:16.977
then I can have it go to top,
fairly simple right?

18
00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:20.605
Now I'm gonna say to top left, and

19
00:01:20.605 --> 00:01:26.111
if you see the mid-point of that gradient,
right,

20
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:32.258
is going from the bottom corner
to the top corner, right.

21
00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:37.240
And the gradient line,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: That's along,

22
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.270
like if I had given 15 different
colors it would go along that line.

23
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.611
So everything's going along that line,
it's perpendicular to

24
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:51.414
the midpoint.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: To top right, they're called

25
00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:56.071
magic corners which is the 50% mark goes
from this corner right here if it didn't

26
00:01:56.071 --> 00:02:01.500
have a border radius to this corner right
here if it didn't have a border radius.

27
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.420
And it's a little off, no it's not
actually, it's perfectly fine, okay, so

28
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.958
basically, that's what's going on.

29
00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:13.370
Your gradient line, is at a right angle
to the mid-point of a line that's

30
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.123
goes from one corner to the other corner.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

31
00:02:18.123 --> 00:02:23.083
it's going from the top, in this case,
it's going to the bottom right,

32
00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:26.210
so it's starting up here and
going down here.

33
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.130
So it is going in the general
direction in the bottom right.

34
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.144
But it's going in the general direction so
that the perpendicular line would go from

35
00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:39.935
corner to corner.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

36
00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:45.548
let's try this, just write to all of them,

37
00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:53.438
to right, to left, to bottom right.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

38
00:02:53.438 --> 00:02:59.507
let's just do 50%.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 50%,

39
00:02:59.507 --> 00:03:04.379
you see how that green line, that yellow
green change goes from corner to corner?

40
00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.002
But the gradient line, so the gradient
line is the line that's going from red to

41
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:11.557
orange to yellow to
green to blue to purple.

42
00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:17.100
So it's actually going from the top
left corner to the bottom right corner,

43
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.578
but it's not actually
hitting either corner.

44
00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:24.868
It's going in such a way that it's
perpendicular to the line that goes from

45
00:03:24.868 --> 00:03:28.084
the bottom left to the top right,
does that make sense?

46
00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:34.838
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So now let's discuss angles.

47
00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:37.867
So we've been declaring
everything with keyterms,

48
00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:40.166
now we can learn how to do it with angles.

49
00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:48.668
So degrees,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: The degrees go,

50
00:03:48.668 --> 00:03:53.099
starting at 12 noon or
at the top, which is 0%.

51
00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.747
The right is 90%, the bottom is 180 and

52
00:03:56.747 --> 00:04:02.514
the left is 270.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So 0 degrees is the same

53
00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:07.808
as top, but
45 degrees is not the same as top right,

54
00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:12.882
because 45 degrees will
always be 45 degrees.

55
00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:15.166
But top right might be
at a different angle,

56
00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:19.006
depending on the aspect ratio.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

57
00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:24.337
the degree is required, you don't have to
degrees, you can use radians or grads.

58
00:04:24.337 --> 00:04:27.937
But no one uses radiance or grad so
we're not really gonna cover them but

59
00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:30.218
you can actually play with it and
it's fine.

60
00:04:30.218 --> 00:04:35.355
So, here I'm just,
right there, I made it 216

61
00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:40.572
degrees.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And so

62
00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:45.955
the degrees is,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 0

63
00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:48.989
degrees is actually where
the black line goes, right?

64
00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:52.257
It's going from 0 degrees,
it's going up and down.

65
00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:54.359
And then the gradient
follows that gradient line.

66
00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:01.418
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And so let's just click on 45

67
00:05:01.418 --> 00:05:06.520
degrees, right, that's 45 degrees and
then let's do top right.

68
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.510
So you see it's slightly different.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

69
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.113
just to reiterate the point
between 45 degrees,

70
00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:18.988
the one that says 45 degrees,
that grading is never gonna change.

71
00:05:18.988 --> 00:05:23.986
The box is gonna get taller, or shorter,
but it's not going to change the angle,

72
00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:27.482
whereas in top right will
actually change its location.

73
00:05:27.482 --> 00:05:32.042
So you see the 45 degree is that angle
is still exactly the way it was,

74
00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:36.470
whereas the gradient line and
the two top right is almost vertical.

75
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.790
And here it's closer to horizontal,
whereas this one is still 45 degrees.

76
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.170
So two top right and
45 degrees are actually different.

77
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.530
So one of the questions that
I got was can you animate it?

78
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.760
And I did it once, so
I did this website called the School for

79
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.393
Machines Who Can't Learn Good and
Want to Do Other Stuff Good Too.

80
00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:58.726
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

81
00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:01.308
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And there's two Easter eggs on

82
00:06:01.308 --> 00:06:06.640
this page, one is the light switch.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

83
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.150
then the other one is
an animated radio gradient.

84
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.575
And it doesn't animate very well.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So,

85
00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:21.275
it is possible to animate but it's kind of

86
00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:26.260
not the best thing to do,
so let's move on.

87
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.642
I'll continue on gradients; and
more I should talk about,

88
00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:32.338
maybe animation in gradients,
when we talk about animations, later on.
