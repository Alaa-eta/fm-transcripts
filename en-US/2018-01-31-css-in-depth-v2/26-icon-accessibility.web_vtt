00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.960
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The thing with a lot of
icons, this is kind of one of the features

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.550
and I thought this was the best
place to talk about it,

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.630
cuz using this user generated content
is actually a really good way to do it.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.590
So there's a lot of icons that
are completely not accessible.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.302
So if I put the snowman,
remember that snowman 2603?

6
00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:23.320
It doesn't say snowman,
when you're using assistive technology.

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.478
So Google came out with
these material icons, and

8
00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:33.913
you can tell that Google does not hire
enough diversity because there is one,

9
00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:38.170
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

10
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.719
eight airplane seats in the material
icons and no pregnant women.

11
00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.240
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I don't know.

12
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.240
Okay, they need a little bit
more diversity at Google but

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.490
they are never going to get it while they
still have the same hiring practices.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.490
That was another opinionated comment.

15
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.231
So what is material icons?

16
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:06.082
If I actually were to do
a view source inspect on this,

17
00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:09.210
I would see a bunch of words.

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.390
And so it'd be airplane_seat_flat,
airplane_seat_angled,

19
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.929
airplane_seat_individual_suite because
who here as ever been able to

20
00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.610
get an individual suite on a plane?

21
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.310
This is not a material icon that I
ever need to use, extra legroom,

22
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.997
I pay still for that, legroom_normal,
legroom_reduced, that's me,

23
00:01:29.997 --> 00:01:34.130
seat_recline, that a person in
front of you that you wanna punch.

24
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.390
Okay, so these are words.

25
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.470
These the screen reader will read, right?

26
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.350
So what they did is they use ligatures.

27
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.060
Have you ever seen an f with an i and then
outside of the f goes to the top of the i?

28
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.550
That's a ligature.

29
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.010
So basically they use ligatures to
say basically when you have the word,

30
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.830
airplane suite, which one's a suite?

31
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.330
This one?

32
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:05.217
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That is so
not worth $10,000 for one line.

33
00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:11.220
So basically, what I did here is
I have a class of material-icons.

34
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.180
It starts with material-icons,
so I can just add a dash and

35
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.310
something else afterwards.

36
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.276
Margins, I'm using marterial icon's font.

37
00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:25.540
And then I have antialiased and
feature-settings on liga.

38
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.329
So, I'm not going to cover fonts in depth
but just realize that these are properties

39
00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.236
like anti-aliased and font feature
settings you can use, like liga.

40
00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:39.220
So these are something you wanna look up.

41
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.990
And then with the generated content,
actually,

42
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.910
here I'm not even using generated content,
I'm just using the word face.

43
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.588
So it's saying, when I have this font,
the ligature of f,

44
00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:56.140
a, c and e combined, produces this.

45
00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:01.830
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
here it's generated content.

46
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.860
Here I have the black one
is material icons and

47
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.540
the word is accessibility and
I have an accessibility icon.

48
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.430
So the screen reader
would read accessibility.

49
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.290
The sighted user would
actually see the icon.

50
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.560
And you generally don't actually wanna
do this because a lot of people don't

51
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.030
understand what this icon means.

52
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.940
So a sighted user might not know that
this means accessibility, right?

53
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.950
But if I change this just
to show you that it works.

54
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.200
Face, you see I typed in face,
and we get a face.

55
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.460
So, there's like a thousand
of these that you can use.

56
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.585
You just have to call in
the material icon's font.

57
00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:50.930
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, this is one thing
you can use with generated content.

58
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.858
The other interesting thing is,
there is also UTF for

59
00:03:56.858 --> 00:04:01.735
browsers that don't support ligatures and

60
00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:08.207
those font features,
you can actually use the \e84e.

61
00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:09.590
The only thing is,

62
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.352
if I do this in a browser that
doesn't support it, what happens?

63
00:04:14.352 --> 00:04:18.174
If this browser doesn't
support the ligature of face,

64
00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.707
what would be written on the bottom?

65
00:04:20.707 --> 00:04:26.553
The word face because the cascade

66
00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:31.150
overwrote the \e84e.

67
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.132
So it would actually say the word face.

68
00:04:32.132 --> 00:04:37.165
So later on, we're going to discuss how
you can actually feature detect whether

69
00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:43.221
the browser supports,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This feature,

70
00:04:43.221 --> 00:04:44.740
which is needed, right?

71
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.230
And then you can use, in that

72
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.227
support query,
you can just put that feature, okay.

73
00:04:56.227 --> 00:04:59.299
So, accessibility.

74
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.116
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Actually what
you would wanna do in this case,

75
00:05:04.116 --> 00:05:09.243
I just thought of the right solution for
this is, you only call this font,

76
00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:15.080
the material icons font, if the ligature
is supported otherwise you'd get face.

77
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.375
That would be the best way to do it.

78
00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.407
Instead of doing this,
this would be stupid,

79
00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:23.608
just basically serve
the word face to everyone.

80
00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:30.275
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or maybe not,
nevermind, ignore that.

81
00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:32.675
Because then you would get the word face
and that might not be what you want.

82
00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:34.549
You actually want the icon.

83
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.170
Okay, accessibility.

84
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.190
I've just been talking
a lot about accessibility.

85
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.820
But let's go over the actual features.

86
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.310
Generated [COUGH] content is actually read
by most screen readers, but it should

87
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.319
enhance the content, it's progressive
enhancement, it should not be relied upon.

88
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.360
Because basically generated content
is part of the presentation layer.

89
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.343
And content is HTML, and
we don't want to mix those concerns up.

90
00:06:08.343 --> 00:06:11.519
And I'm not just saying you don't want to
mix it up and that's a steadfast rule and

91
00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:12.082
that's why.

92
00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:16.250
But this is just one of the examples
of you want the content to actually be

93
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.139
on the page if it's important.

94
00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:24.149
So you can use these features if you
want to improve user experience,

95
00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:28.822
but don't make it a requirement
of user experience.

96
00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.167
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If you
are really into accessibility,

97
00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:38.848
the generated content is part of
the accessible name computation of,

98
00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:42.830
there's an accessibility object model.

99
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.130
And it is actually going to be
in there if it's not already.

100
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.080
And all browsers except for

101
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.990
Internet Explorer expose
generated content to expose it.

102
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.468
And therefore it can be
read by the screen user.

103
00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:07.180
So in the future right now
we just have content, right?

104
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.600
We would just say content
url question_svg, right?

105
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.305
In the future,
we'll be able to put a slash and

106
00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:20.254
basically a hint as to what it means.

107
00:07:20.254 --> 00:07:24.717
Because those icons that I was
talking to you about, that face,

108
00:07:24.717 --> 00:07:28.861
the side user is like,
I have no clue why that face is there.

109
00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:33.844
And that bed lining I had no clue that
that was on airplane suite because

110
00:07:33.844 --> 00:07:36.840
it's not made my daily lexicon.

111
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.410
If something is gonna
be purely decorative,

112
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.520
like 25ba, I have no clue what 25ba,
but like the snowman,

113
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.460
purely decorative, does not add to
the context, you can just put a slash and

114
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.680
then empty quotes so that it won't
be read to the screen reader.

115
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.810
So this is providing more information

116
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.290
because there's no way to put an alt
attribute on generated content, right?

117
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.430
I've had that picture of myself.

118
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.380
No screen user would know that
that was a picture of me.

119
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.826
But I would write and then they would know
what they were supposed to be looking at.
