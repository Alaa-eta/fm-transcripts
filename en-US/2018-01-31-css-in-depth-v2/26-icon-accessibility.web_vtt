00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.530
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The thing with a lot
of icons, this is kind of like one of

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.550
the other features, and I though this
was the best place to talk about it,

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.630
cuz using this as generated content is
actually a really good way to do it.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.590
So, there's a lot of icons that
are completely not accessible.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.440
So, if I put the snowman,
remember that snowman 2603?

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.360
It doesn't say snow man when
you're using assistive technology.

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.180
So Google came out with
its material icons and

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.580
you could tell Google does
not hire enough diversity.

9
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.535
Because there's one, two,
three, four, five, six,

10
00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:41.890
seven, eight, eight airplane
seats in a material icons and

11
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.459
no pregnant women
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I don't know.

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.016
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, they need
a little bit diversity at Google but

13
00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.140
they never gonna get it well.

14
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.490
They still have the same hiring practices.

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.515
That was another opinionated comment.

16
00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

17
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.479
what is material icons?

18
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.640
If I actually were to do
a view source inspect on this,

19
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.660
I would see a bunch of words.

20
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.530
And so it would be airplane seat flat,

21
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.070
airplane seat angled,
airplane seat individual suite.

22
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.610
Because who here has ever been able
to get individual suite on a plane?

23
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.920
This is not a material icon
that I ever need to use.

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.570
Extra legroom, I pay still for that.

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.370
Legroom normal,
legroom reduced, that's me.

26
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.664
Seat reclined, that's the person in
front of you that you want to punch.

27
00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:36.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so these are words.

28
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.470
This is screen reader will read, right?

29
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.350
So what they did is they used ligatures.

30
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.060
Have you ever seen an F with an I and the
outside of the F goes to the top of the I?

31
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.550
That's a ligature.

32
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.010
So basically they use ligatures to
say basically when you have the word

33
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.830
airplanes suite, which one is a suite?

34
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.330
This one?

35
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.577
That is so not worth $10,000 for
one [INAUDIBLE].

36
00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:10.340
So basically what I did here is I
have a class of material icons.

37
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.310
It's such a material icon so I can just
add a dash and something else afterwards.

38
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.780
Margins using material icons
material-icons font and

39
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.850
then I have antialiased and
feature-settings of liga.

40
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.300
So I'm not gonna cover fonts in depth but
just realize that these are properties

41
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.110
like antialiased and there's font future
studies that you can use like liga.

42
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.200
So this something you wanna look
up if you're [INAUDIBLE] and

43
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.270
then with the generated
content actually here,

44
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.910
I'm not even using generated content
I'm just using the word face.

45
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.507
So saying when I have this font,
the ligature of f a c and

46
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.528
e combined produces this.

47
00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.830
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
here it's generated content.

48
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.860
Here I have the black one
is material-icons and

49
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.540
the word is accessibility, and
I have an accessibility icon.

50
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.430
So the screen reader
would read accessibility.

51
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.560
The sighted user would actually see

52
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.180
the icon and you generally
don't actually want to do this,

53
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.030
because a lot of people don't
understand what the icon means.

54
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.627
So a site user might not know that
this means accessibility, right?

55
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.288
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: But if I change this
just to show you that it works, face,

56
00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:35.308
you see that I typed face and
we get a face.

57
00:03:35.308 --> 00:03:39.460
So there's a thousand of
these that you can use.

58
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.594
You just have to call in
the material icon's font.

59
00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.110
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So this is one thing
you can use with generated content.

60
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.230
The other interesting
thing is there's also UTF.

61
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.270
For browsers that don't
support ligatures and

62
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.615
those font features,
you can actually use the \ea4e.

63
00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:12.510
The only thing is, if I do this in
a browser that doesn't support it,

64
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.109
what happens?

65
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.921
If the browser doesn't support ligature of
face, what would be written on the bottom?

66
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:26.880
The word face because
the cascade overwrote the \e84e.

67
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.330
So it would actually say the word face.

68
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.870
So later along we're going to discuss
how you can actually feature the text.

69
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.740
Whether the browser supports this feature,
which is needed, right?

70
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.230
And then you can use in that

71
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.514
support query you can
just put that feature.

72
00:04:56.514 --> 00:05:01.020
Okay, so accessibility.

73
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.820
Actually what you would
wanted to in this case,

74
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.780
I just thought of the right solution for
this is.

75
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.040
You only call this font, the material
icons font if the literature is supported,

76
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.580
otherwise you get Face.

77
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.160
That would be the best way to do it.

78
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.539
Instead of doing this,
this would be stupid,

79
00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.043
just basically serve
the word face to everyone.

80
00:05:26.457 --> 00:05:30.490
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or maybe not,
never mind, ignore that.

81
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.960
Because then you would get the word face
and that might not be what you want.

82
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.460
You actually want the icon.

83
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.170
Okay, accessibility.

84
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.300
I've just been talking a lot
about accessibility but

85
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.820
let's go over the actual features.

86
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.030
General content is actually
read by most screen readers but

87
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.350
it should enhance the content.

88
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.520
It's progressive enhancement.

89
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.228
It should not be the base of your
it should not be relied upon.

90
00:05:57.515 --> 00:06:00.859
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because basically
generated content is part of

91
00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:04.287
the presentation layer and
content is HTML, and

92
00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:07.140
you don't wanna mix those concerns up.

93
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.530
And I'm not just saying you don't wanna
mix it up and that's a steadfast rule and

94
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.820
that's why, but
this is just one of the examples of,

95
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.200
you want the content to actually
be on the page, if it's important.

96
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.570
So you can use these features if you want
to improve your sort of experience but

97
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.610
don't make it a requirement
of user experience.

98
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.980
If you're really into accessibility,
the generated content

99
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.740
is part of the accessible name
computation of, there's an accessibility

100
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.130
object model, and it is actually going
to be in there if it's not already.

101
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.170
And all browsers except for Internet
Explorer expose generated content to the,

102
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.439
expose it, and
therefore can be read by the screen user.

103
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.053
So in the future right now,

104
00:07:04.053 --> 00:07:08.800
we have content right?

105
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.494
It would say content
url(question.svg) right?

106
00:07:13.494 --> 00:07:19.060
In the future, we'll be able to put
a slash and basically a hint as

107
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:25.030
to what it means, because those icons that
I was talking to you about, that face?

108
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:30.160
The site user, it's like I have no clue
why that face is there and that bed lying,

109
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.620
I had no clue that that was
an airplane suite because I It's not

110
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.840
in my daily lexicon.

111
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.980
It's something that's gonna be
purely decorative like 25BA.

112
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.670
I have no clue what 25BA but
like the snowman purely decorative.

113
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.480
Does not add to the content or context.

114
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.880
You can just put a slash and
then empty quotes so

115
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.810
that it won't be read to the screen reader
so this providing more information.

116
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.290
Because there's no way to put an alt
attribute on generated content, right?

117
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.932
I've had that picture of myself, no screen
reader user would know that that was

118
00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:08.188
a picture of me, but
I could write cheesy svg still, and

119
00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:11.536
they would know what they were
supposed to be looking at.
