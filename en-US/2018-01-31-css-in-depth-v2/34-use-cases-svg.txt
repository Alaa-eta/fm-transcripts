>> Estelle Weyl: So another reason to use media queries or an interesting thing about media queries is SVG. Generally, when you say width, screen and width, the width is the device width if you're on a mobile device or tablet, and the browser width, if you're on a device where you can just change the size of the browser.

[00:00:27]
When it comes to an SVG, the screen is actually the width of the container of the SVG. So if I hit play with this, and right now the background, I have a circle SVG. And I say background is 50%. It changed colors.
>> Estelle Weyl: And 20% it changed colors again.

[00:00:57]
Because it's the size of the SVG container. And the SVG container is 20% of the width of the parent. And so it's basically saying if the parent were a 1,000 and I know it's more but I'm just going to use a thousand so then I can do math.

[00:01:13]
So if it's 1,000 pixels wide, that would mean when it's 200 pixels wide, it should be green. When it's 300 pixels wide, it should be blue. When it's 400 pixels wide, it should be whatever color that is. Whatever color that is, whatever color that is and orange. 9 and 100, okay.

[00:01:38]
So, let's take a look at circle SVG.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, and then do a view source.
>> Estelle Weyl: So here, I basically said if it's under 100 pixels make the color bad ass. If it's under 300 pixels. I did 300 pixels twice, this is supposed to be 200 pixels. 506, so you have these different break points.

[00:02:24]
And they're not break points decided on any tablet that I know of. It's just break points that I picked because it made sense.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then
>> Estelle Weyl: It basically says the width of the height of this SVG is by default 400 pixels. But that's not what my HTML is saying.

[00:02:50]
My HTML is saying, make it 70%.
>> Estelle Weyl: How did it get this big? And what am I going to do about it?
>> Speaker 2: You zoomed in [INAUDIBLE].
>> Estelle Weyl: But I didn't actually. Okay, thank you. I didn't actually think I did that. I'm like all of a sudden, I didn't know I touched anything.

[00:03:16]
Okay, so basically I'm saying the size, the background size is the container of that SVG. And I was making it 70% of the width, 60% of the width of the width, 100% of the width. So it's not taking the size of the screen, which is what 99.9% of the time happens when it's in SVG.

[00:03:41]
The min width and max width is actually the size of the SVG container.
