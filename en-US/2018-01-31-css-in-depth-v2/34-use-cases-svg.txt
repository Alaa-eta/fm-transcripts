[00:00:03]
>> Steve Kinney: So another reason to use media queries, or an interesting thing about media queries, is SVG. Generally, when you say width, screen and width, the width is the device width if you're on a mobile device or a tablet. And the browser width, if you're on a device where you can just change the size of the browser.

[00:00:27]
When it comes to an SVG, the screen is actually the width of the container of the SVG. So if I hit play with this, and right now, the background, I have a circle SVG and if I say background is 50% it change colors.
>> Steve Kinney: And 20% it change colors again, because it's the size of the SVG container and the SVG container is 20% of the width of the parent.

[00:01:05]
And so it's basically saying if the parent were a 1,000 pixels which, I know it's more, but I'm just going to use a 1,000, cuz then I can do math. So if it was a 1,000 pixels wide, that would mean when it's 200 pixels wide, it should be green, when it's 300 pixels wide, it should be blue.

[00:01:23]
When it's 400 pixels wide, it should be whatever color that is, whatever color that is, whatever color that is, and orange. And [INAUDIBLE] I had 100. Okay, so let's take a look at circle.svg.
>> Steve Kinney: Okay, and then do a view source.
>> Steve Kinney: So here I basically said if it's under 100 pixels, make the color badass.

[00:02:14]
If it's under 300 pixels, I did 300 pixels twice, this is supposed to be 200 pixels. 506, so we have these different break points. And they're not break points decided on any tablet that I know of, it's just break points that I picked because it made sense.
>> Steve Kinney: And then,

[00:02:41]

>> Steve Kinney: It basically says the width and the height of this SVG is by default 400 pixels. But that's not what my HTML is saying, my HTML is saying make it 70%.
>> Steve Kinney: How did it get this big?
>> Steve Kinney: And what am I gonna do about it?
>> Speaker 2: You zoomed in.

[00:03:02]

>> Steve Kinney: No.
>> Speaker 2: Zero [INAUDIBLE]
>> Steve Kinney: But it didn't actually give me a zero. Okay, thank you. I didn't actually think I did that. I'm like all of a sudden, I didn't know I touched anything. Okay, so basically I'm saying the background size is the container of that SVG.

[00:03:24]
And I'm just making it 70% of the width, 60% of the width, 100% of the width. So it's not taking the size of the screen, which is what 99.9% of the time happens, when it's in SVG, the min width and max width is actually the size of the SVG container.
