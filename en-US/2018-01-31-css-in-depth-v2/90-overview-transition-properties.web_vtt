00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.520
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So now let's move
on to transitions and animations.

2
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.435
If you are following along, the URL is
Estelle.GitHub.io/cssmastery/animations.

3
00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.377
If you haven't heard me say this before.

4
00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:19.620
All you have to do is remember my name,
Estelle.

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.690
Go to my GitHub, Estelle.GitHub.io.

6
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.990
And either look for the CSS mastery class,
and click on the animations link.

7
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.870
Or, go to CSS mastery, and
you'll find the link there.

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.960
So, first let's talk about transitions.

9
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.170
Now I can ask the question.

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.470
Who here has ever done a transition?

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.620
Everyone has, because everyone has
changed a link color on hover.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400
That's a transition.

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.106
It is a transition over zero seconds.

14
00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:52.310
You can say,
take a full second to do it, and

15
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.327
you have a really bad user experience but
you can do it.

16
00:00:55.327 --> 00:01:02.670
You can also say basically, all the links
take two seconds before your transition.

17
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.280
That's a nice little April Fool's joke or
a horrible April Fool's joke.

18
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.890
Okay, so let's talk a little
about the transition properties.

19
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.990
I just showed you how
simple a transition is.

20
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.320
You just basically say,
do it over one second, and we're good.

21
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.150
But we have several transition properties.

22
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.180
We have the transition property property,

23
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.685
which is the properties
you wanna transition.

24
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.975
The key term All, which is the default.

25
00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:26.643
You have transition duration, which is
how long should the transition take.

26
00:01:26.643 --> 00:01:31.651
You have transition timing function,
which is a Bezier curve of transition and

27
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:34.950
we'll go deep dive into
this during the animation.

28
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670
So if you don't understand that yet,
don't worry.

29
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.710
Transition delay is the seconds or
milliseconds, and

30
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.951
it is required that you include the s or
the ms before the transition starts.

31
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:49.090
The MS and the S are both required for
transition duration and transition delay.

32
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.070
And then there is a transition which
is short hand for all four properties.

33
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.740
So, in this example, wooo that is bad,
but yes, it is transitioning.

34
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.050
On hover, when I hover over the code,
the color goes from black to red.

35
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.618
Maybe, I don't know.

36
00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:11.413
The font size goes from 85% to 120%.

37
00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:19.900
The background color goes from white
opaque to white slightly less opaque.

38
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.560
And here we go.

39
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.480
It actually is blue, not red.

40
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.760
The color used to be red on this deck,
and I changed it to blue.

41
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.480
I did a global search and
replace, and this is what happens.

42
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.832
So basically it's the same as writing.

43
00:02:36.832 --> 00:02:42.079
So what I wrote, my transition code is
code, transition color, font size, and

44
00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:48.120
background size, over two seconds, ease
in but wait 50 milliseconds for it to go.

45
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.760
So if I go like this,
it didn't start transitioning

46
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.440
because I was over that slide for
less than 50 milliseconds.

47
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.230
If you're gonna do a transition effect on
a link other than just changing the color,

48
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.860
it's good to wait 50 milliseconds just in
case someone is dragging them out to one

49
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.700
part of the page to the other.

50
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.060
50 milliseconds is not long enough for
someone to notice a delay.

51
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.220
But having something jump
out of them is noticable.

52
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.810
I could have also written
all 2s ease-in 50 ms.

53
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.100
What is transitioning is any property
that is from the previous state to

54
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.850
the current state.

55
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.298
A better effect because you saw
how choppy that was, right,

56
00:03:33.298 --> 00:03:36.244
would be to actually use transforms.

57
00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:41.120
So here, look how nice and smooth that is.

58
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.610
The problem is because I'm transforming
it, I'm growing it, right?

59
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.054
Before I was pushing the bottom code down,
and here I'm not,

60
00:03:48.054 --> 00:03:55.398
I'm actually going right over it.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

61
00:03:55.398 --> 00:04:00.426
so when you're transitioning something,
the stacking context comes up,

62
00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:03.958
so that's why the z index
might be the exact same, but

63
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:09.400
that code is gonna be on top of it because
the bottom one is not being transitioned.

64
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.740
So this is a better effect,
has better performance.

65
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.520
But it might not be the effect you want.

66
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.310
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You keep the same like ounce

67
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.208
in the like the flow of the page edge,

68
00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:22.288
when you're transforming it like that.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.

69
00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:23.478
Nothing else would have moved.

70
00:04:23.478 --> 00:04:26.853
It's only repainting that one element and
it's growing it bigger.
