00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:07.792
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So now let's move
on to transitions and animations.

2
00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:14.820
If you are following along the URL is
estelle.github.io/cssmastery/animations,

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.107
if you haven't heard me say this before.

4
00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:21.248
All you have to do is remember my name,
Estelle, go to my GitHub,

5
00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:22.459
estelle.github.io.

6
00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:27.149
And either look for the CSS Mastery class
and click on the animations link or

7
00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.290
go to CSS Mastery and
you'll find the link there.

8
00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:34.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So first,
let's talk about transitions.

9
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.454
Now I can ask the question,
who here has ever done a transition?

10
00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:43.148
Everyone has because everyone has
changed a link color on Hover.

11
00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:43.757
Right?

12
00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:45.057
That's a transition.

13
00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:48.659
It is a transition over zero seconds.

14
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.794
You can say take a full
second to do it and

15
00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:56.074
you have really bad user experience but
you can do it.

16
00:00:56.074 --> 00:01:01.497
You can also say basically all the links
take two seconds before you transition

17
00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:06.280
as a nice little April Fools' joke or
a horrible April Fools' joke.

18
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.890
Okay, so let's talk a little bit
about the transition properties.

19
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.990
I just showed you how
simple a transition is.

20
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.320
You just basically say,
do it over one second, we're good.

21
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.150
But we have several transition properties.

22
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.906
We have the transition-property property,

23
00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.710
which is the properties
you wanna transition.

24
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.458
The key term all which is the default.

25
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:27.026
You have transition-duration which is
how long should the transition take.

26
00:01:27.026 --> 00:01:32.430
You have transition-timing-function which
is a bazier curve of transition and

27
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.950
we'll go into deep dive into
this during the animation.

28
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.045
So if you don't understand that yet,
don't worry.

29
00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:40.712
Transition-delay is the seconds or
milliseconds and

30
00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:45.821
it is required that you include the s or
the ms before the transition starts.

31
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:49.781
The ms and the s are both required for
transition duration and transition delay.

32
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:54.877
And then there is the transition which
is short-hand for all four properties.

33
00:01:54.877 --> 00:02:01.495
So in this example, ooh, that is bad but
yes, it is transitioning.

34
00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:06.424
On Hover, when I hover over the code,
the color goes from black to red,

35
00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:08.078
maybe, I don't know.

36
00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:12.378
The font size goes from 85% to 120%.

37
00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:19.670
The background color goes from white,
opaque to white, slightly less opaque.

38
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.619
And here we go.

39
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.480
It actually is blue, not red.

40
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.580
The color used to be red on the stack and
I changed it to blue.

41
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.449
I did a global search and
replace and this is what happens.

42
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:36.510
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So basically,
it's the same as writing.

43
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.500
So what I wrote, my transition code is
code, transition color, font size, and

44
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.840
background size.

45
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.120
Over two seconds ease in but
wait 50 milliseconds for it to go.

46
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.820
So if I go like this,
it didn't start transitioning

47
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.440
cuz I was over that slide for
less than 50 milliseconds.

48
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.230
If you're gonna do a transition effect on
a link other than just changing the color,

49
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.790
it's good to wait 50 milliseconds just in
case someone is dragging their mouse from

50
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.700
one part of the page to the other.

51
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.180
50 milliseconds is not long enough for
someone to notice a delay but

52
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.900
having something jump out
at them is noticable.

53
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.810
I could have also written
all 2 seconds ease-in 50ms.

54
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.751
What is transitioning is any property that
is from the previous state to the current

55
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.252
state.

56
00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:33.591
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: A better effect, because
you saw how choppy that was, right?

57
00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:37.544
Would be to actually use transforms.

58
00:03:37.544 --> 00:03:41.120
So here, look how nice and smooth that is.

59
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.430
The problem is because I'm transforming
it, I'm growing it, right?

60
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.994
Before I was pushing the bottom code down.

61
00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:49.793
And here I'm not,
I'm actually going right over it.

62
00:03:55.204 --> 00:03:57.208
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so
when you're transitioning something,

63
00:03:57.208 --> 00:03:58.520
that stacking context comes up.

64
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.452
So that's why this index
might be the exact same.

65
00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:08.046
But that code is gonna be on top
of it because the bottom one

66
00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:10.358
is not being transitioned.

67
00:04:10.358 --> 00:04:13.422
So this is a better effect,
has better performance but

68
00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:15.425
it might not be the effect you want.

69
00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:15.973
Yes?

70
00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:20.461
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you keep the same in the
flow of the page when you're transforming

71
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:22.265
it like that and making it big?

72
00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:23.463
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
nothing else would have moved.

73
00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:26.957
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's only repainting that

74
00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:31.603
one element and it's growing it bigger.
