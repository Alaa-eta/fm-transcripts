>> Estelle Weyl: Rachel Andrews, who is awesome, has this website called Grid by Example and there's a little button that says start here and that's where you should start to learn the basics. You basically know the basics but you're gonna forget everything I just told you today cuz you're gonna have so much by the end of the day that your brain is going to explode.

[00:00:20]
So you wanna come here, and then Jen Simmons has an intro to CSS, and it's not just an intro to CSS, but she has all of these labs. So when you go to her webpage. I'm just gonna go to jensimmons.com, here it is, Jen Simmons. There's a little thing right here called labs.

[00:00:40]
You click on labs and she has like a monopoly done with CSS grid.
>> Estelle Weyl: She's a great graphic designer, so she basically has this example here. Where that is a much more beautiful website than having everything like, she makes very good use of white space. And so here we have five images placed in a grid where she basically said this is the row I want and this is the column I want.

>> Estelle Weyl: They're what you call explicitly placed and then she has some artwork here. A responsive Mondrian,
>> Estelle Weyl: Here and then when you actually switch, that did not work. Yeah, it shrank. It's Fluid Mondrian, I think that's the one, okay.
>> Estelle Weyl: No, there's one where it actually changes.
>> Estelle Weyl: Yeah, so this one, you'll see that it changes as you grow it.

[00:02:03]

>> Estelle Weyl: So what you wanna do with these things is you wanna take a look at them, go wow, that's amazing and then do a view source. Look at she created it and take a look at the CSS and go, wow, that's so easy. Grid, once you get used to it, makes laying out pages super easy.
