>> Steve Kinney: Rachel Andrews who is awesome has this website called Grid by Example and there's a little in it to start here and that's where you should start to learn the basics. You basically know the basics but you're gonna forget everything I just told you today cuz you're gonna have so much by the end of the day that your brain is going to explode, so you wanna come here.

And then Jen Simmons has an intro to CSS. And it's not just an intro to CSS, but she has all of these labs. So when you go to her web page, I'm just going to go to jensimons.com, here it is, Jen Simmons. There is a little thing right here called labs.

You click on labs, and she has a monopoly done with CSS grid.
>> Steve Kinney: She's a great graphic designer, so she basically has this example here.
>> Steve Kinney: Where that is a much more beautiful website than having everything, she makes very good use of white space. And so here, we have five images placed in a grid, where she basically said, this is the row I want and this is the column I want.

>> Steve Kinney: They're what you call explicitly placed. And then she has some artwork here, a responsive Mondrian here.
>> Steve Kinney: And then when you actually switch, that did not work, yeah, it shrank, that's not that, Fluid Mondrian, I think that's the one, okay.
>> Steve Kinney: Nope, there's one where it actually changes.

[00:01:55]

>> Steve Kinney: Yeah, so this one, you'll see that it changes as you grow it.
>> Steve Kinney: So what you wanna do with these things is you wanna take a look at them. Go wow, that's amazing, and then do a view source, look at how she created it, and take a look at the CSS, and go wow, that's so easy.

Grid, once you get used to it, it makes laying out pages super easy.
