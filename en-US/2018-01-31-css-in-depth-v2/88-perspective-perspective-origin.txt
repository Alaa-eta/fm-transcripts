[00:00:01]
>> Steve Kinney: So let's take a look at perspective. There's two ways to declare perspective. Either you can declare it as the first value, the first function of the transform property. If it's not the first, it doesn't do anything, okay? So you always wanna start with perspective if you're doing 3D transforms and you're gonna include perspective.

[00:00:25]

>> Steve Kinney: So perspective, you can put the perspective property itself on an individual element or on the parent. And the difference between putting it on an individual element versus on the parent is if you put it on the parent, all of its children will have the same perspective, so they'll all go out or whatever.

[00:00:43]
And if you put it on each individual one, each will look the exact same.
>> Steve Kinney: I'll show you an example of that, I think. So here, we have a perspective of 40. You can also have a perspective of 400, or a 4. And 4 is gonna look crazy.

[00:01:01]
Oops,
>> Steve Kinney: Right?. The smaller the number, it's basically this is 4 pixels for my eyeball, and this is 40 pixels for my eyeball. And this is 400 pixels for my eyeball. And so if we rotate it 80 degrees, right, and then we do 40, it's basically, I have this piece of paper right here that says RSVP on it.

[00:01:37]

>> Steve Kinney: So, remember that the perspective function must come first and that smaller numbers are basically closer to your eye and have a bigger impact.
>> Steve Kinney: So here, I put the perspective on the parent. And it looks almost the same right? Doesn't make much of a difference when there's one, but you can really see it when you have multiple elements, and here is that.

[00:02:05]
You see here, the perspective of 400 pixels is put on the child, and these 3 look identical. Whereas here I put 400 pixels on the parent, and you're basically looking at it from here, and so all of them are basically angling to the same point. So you'll generally, if you have one element, just put it on the child.

[00:02:26]
If you have multiple elements and you're doing a city scene or something like that, put it on the parent of the whole thing. Okay, next we're gonna cover perspective-origin. So right now, we've been basically staring at it dead center. Perspective-origin, you can give it an x or a y, and it's basically where the viewer appears to be looking at the child.

[00:02:50]

>> Steve Kinney: So here I have two of them. I have a perspective from the top left, and perspective from the top right.
>> Steve Kinney: So each one of these has perspective of 100, let's make it 60. Make it more obnoxious. Let's make it 120, so it's more reasonable. So this is number one, and this is number two, I believe, right?

[00:03:19]
Okay, yeah. And this is center, default to center, right? Top right. So, let's just look at this. So, one of them is top right. And the other one is just right. Let's do center right. It's not that much of a difference, you can play around with it until you figure out what you like.

[00:03:51]
Just realize, this is perspective origin, you can actually say, I'm looking at it from here. I'm looking at it from there. Perspective origin only works if the perspective is on the parents. Here's on the child and had no impact whatsoever. If you look at this in the previous one, same thing.

[00:04:14]
So here, I'm looking at it from over to the right. That's perspective origin. Transform-origin is something you're gonna use all the time, and it doesn't have to be a 3D element. So basically it's where, when you rotate something or you're rotating right now, it's by default, it's the center of that element.

[00:04:36]
But you could also make it the upper corner or you could make it somewhere completely else. So here,
>> Steve Kinney: I don't like that example. Okay, so this a better example. Here the transform origin property is in the upper left hand corner. It is rotating around this mark right there.

[00:04:57]

>> Steve Kinney: 120, right? So no matter where I do it, that top corner is always gonna be touching.
>> Steve Kinney: Right, you see how it's always touching? 320, it's always touching. Now, let's do bottom,
>> Steve Kinney: Oop, bottom right. So this corner right here is always touching. It looks like it's not touching cuz these shadows are overlapping, but that little corner right there, it's on top of it.

[00:05:36]
So, 120, 220, 320, and then 420 because 420 is a cool number.
