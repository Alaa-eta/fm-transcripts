00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, to better
understand grids, we have terminology.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.043
A grid line is a line
basically in the gutter.

3
00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:15.219
There's one on the left of the grid,
there's one on the right of the grid, and

4
00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.450
then there's one between each row,
and each column.

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.490
There's one on top and
there's one on the bottom.

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.550
So if you have a three by three grid,
you actually have four

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.460
lines going vertically and
four lines going horizontally.

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.483
A grid cell is any cell
such as the number ten.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.574
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: A grid
area is a space basically,

10
00:00:38.574 --> 00:00:41.729
I have no clue what a grid area is.

11
00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.682
It's basically say this area here because
you can give certain things names, and

12
00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:48.784
we're gonna cover that later on.

13
00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:53.790
A grid track is either a grid row or
a grid column.

14
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.592
It's any area between two grid lines,
vertically or horizontally.

15
00:00:57.592 --> 00:01:03.821
So grid row is one that's horizontal, and
a grid column is one that's vertical.

16
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:08.964
And then the gutter is the grid gap
that's in between here, that white space.

17
00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:11.752
I'm gonna just open this up
in the debugger right here.

18
00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:14.989
So this is the grid gap here.

19
00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:16.879
This is a grid cell.

20
00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:20.554
Seven through 12 is a grid row.

21
00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:25.190
Two through 20, or there might
be some below, is a grid column.

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.631
And then the grid line is this line on
the left, the line in between here,

23
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.353
the line between here,
the line between three and four.

24
00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:35.640
The line between four and five,
the line between five and six, and

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.294
the line right after number six.

26
00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:38.416
So that's a grid line.

27
00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:43.600
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so
let's see, is it ready?

28
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.650
Let's check, can I use and
have a network for us?

29
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.570
So can I use?

30
00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:56.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And if we go to grid.

31
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.010
Look at all that beautiful green.

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.670
It dropped into production,
I think on October 17th in MS Edge.

33
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.050
And since then, it's basically every
single Evergreen browser has it.

34
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.404
Older versions of IE, so if I show all
of them, have an older syntax of grid.

35
00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:21.142
So you can actually use grid
with all of the edge and

36
00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:25.777
strong with IE10, but
it has a slightly different syntax.

37
00:02:25.777 --> 00:02:27.702
I'm not gonna cover that syntax today.

38
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.801
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay.

39
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:37.568
So the properties we've seen so

40
00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:42.205
far are the display element with grid or
in line grid.

41
00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:45.630
We've shown grid template columns
which you might not have noticed, but

42
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.840
that was basically determining
the size of the different columns.

43
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.380
We created a grid gap,
there was room between the gaps.

44
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.840
On the child, we placed that pink
element using grid columns and grid row.

45
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.045
And we also add two values that
you may have never seen before.

46
00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:07.076
For the grid template columns,
we had used a unit called fr,

47
00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:10.280
and we had repeated some stuff.

48
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.480
So we're gonna cover
all of that right now.

49
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.740
So first let's start by
setting up the grid.

50
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.462
To set up the grid, [COUGH] we have
properties that are on the parent.

51
00:03:24.462 --> 00:03:26.710
We have the displayed property.

52
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.793
We have the displayed template columns,

53
00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:33.589
which says basically
the width of all the columns.

54
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.539
Grid template rows,
which is the height of all the rows.

55
00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:41.298
We have a short hand for
it which is grid template.

56
00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:45.600
And then, we could have a grid
column gap and a grid row gap.

57
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.720
Which there's a shorthand, and
you could just say grid gap, and

58
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600
not just the vertical and
horizontal spacing.

59
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.900
In grid, all of your vertical gaps
are gonna be the same size, and

60
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.500
all of your horizontal gaps are gonna
be the same length as well.

61
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.200
But those could be two different lengths.

62
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.962
But you can't have, and you probably don't
want, different sized gaps between things.

63
00:04:08.388 --> 00:04:10.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we're gonna cover those first, and

64
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.582
then we're gonna cover grid items.

65
00:04:11.582 --> 00:04:15.679
And then, we're gonna cover the other
properties of how to align whole rows.
