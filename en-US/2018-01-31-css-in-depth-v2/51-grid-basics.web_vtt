00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So to better
understand grids we have terminology.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.990
A grid line is a line
basically in the gutter.

3
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.750
There's one on the left of grid,
there's one on the right of the grid, and

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.450
then there's one between each row and
each column.

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.490
There's one on the top and
there's one on the bottom.

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.550
So if you have a three by three grid,
you actually have four

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.460
lines going vertically and
four lines going horizontally.

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.462
A grid cell is any cell,
such as the number ten.

9
00:00:35.412 --> 00:00:36.658
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: A grid
area is a space basically,

10
00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:37.910
I have no clue what a grid area is.

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.873
It's basically when you just
basically say this area here

12
00:00:42.873 --> 00:00:46.630
because you can give certain things names.

13
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.170
And we're gonna cover that later on.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.070
A grid track is either a grid row or
a grid column.

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.960
It's any area between two grid lines,
vertically or horizontally.

16
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.270
So grid row is when it's horizontal.

17
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.280
And a grid column is one that is vertical,
and

18
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.010
then the gutter is the grid gap that
is in between here, that white space.

19
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.130
I'm just going to open this up
in the debugger right here, so

20
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.450
this is the grid gap here,
this is a grid cell.

21
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.960
7 through 12 is a grid row.

22
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.190
2 through 20, or there might be
at some below, is a grid column.

23
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.560
And then the grid line is this line on
the left, the line in between here,

24
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.730
the line between here, the line between
3 and 4, the line between 4 and 5.

25
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.830
The line between 5 and 6, and
the line right after number 6,

26
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.170
so that's a grid line.

27
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.658
Let's see, is it ready, let's check,
can I use and have it not work for us?

28
00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:55.280
So can I use?

29
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.223
If we go to grid,
look at all that beautiful green.

30
00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:04.133
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It dropped into
production I think on October 17th in

31
00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:04.670
MS Edge.

32
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.050
And since then, it's basically every
single Evergreen browser has it.

33
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.190
Older versions of IE, so if I show all
of them have an older syntax of Grid.

34
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.390
So you can actually use grid
with all of the edge and

35
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.040
strong with IE 10, but
it has a slightly different syntax.

36
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.350
I'm not gonna cover that syntax today.

37
00:02:32.283 --> 00:02:35.457
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
the properties we've seen so

38
00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:42.190
far are the display element with grid,
or we could have in-line grid.

39
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.630
We've show template columns,
which you might not have noticed, but

40
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.840
that was basically determining
the sizes of the different columns.

41
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.920
We created a grid gap.

42
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.330
There was room between the gaps.

43
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.840
On the child, we placed that pink
element using grid columns and grid row.

44
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.056
And we also had two new values,
which you may have never seen before.

45
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:05.070
For the grid-template-columns,

46
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.280
we had used a unit called fr and
we had repeated some stuff.

47
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.480
So we're going to cover
all of that right now.

48
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.740
So first let's start by
setting up the grid.

49
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.840
To set up the grid [COUGH] we have
properties that are on the parent.

50
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.990
We have the display property.

51
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.090
We have the display template columns,

52
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.460
which says basically
the width of all the columns.

53
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.410
The grid template rows,
which is the height of all the rows.

54
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.600
We have a shorthand for it,
which is grid template.

55
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.600
And then we can have a grid column gap and
grid row gap.

56
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.720
Which there's a shorthand, and
you can just say grid gap, and

57
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600
not just the vertical and
horizontal spacing.

58
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.900
In grid, all of your vertical gaps
are going to be the same size, and

59
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.500
all of your horizontal gaps are going
to be the same length as well.

60
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.190
But those could be two different lengths.

61
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.070
What you can't have, and

62
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.059
you probably don't want is different
sized gaps between things.

63
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.990
So we're going to cover those first,
then we're going to cover great items then

64
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.410
we're going to cover the other
properties of how to align full rows.
