00:00:02.587 --> 00:00:04.370
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then we
have background-clip and

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.093
background-origin property.

3
00:00:06.093 --> 00:00:11.761
So the background-clip is where
do you start your background.

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:16.509
So here the background color
on all of these is blue but

5
00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.266
the first one has the background
clip of content box.

6
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:26.050
So that means the background color is just
starting in the content box because this

7
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.850
has actual padding.

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.580
There is padding from the inside
of the border to the blue area.

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.616
The padding boxes make the content and
the padding have the background.

10
00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:43.086
And the border boxes actually include the
background, even underneath the border.

11
00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:48.525
So right here I have a dotted border so
that you can see it but normally you

12
00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:54.525
would have a solid border and you might
actually be missing part of your image.

13
00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:56.509
So if you have a border on an element and

14
00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:00.353
you have an image that's supposed to
start in the upper left hand corner,

15
00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:04.760
you wanna use padding-box cuz otherwise
your background's gonna start up there.

16
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:13.149
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The background
image is missing on this, so

17
00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.125
I can't actually show you but it's
basically the background origin is when

18
00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:19.939
you have what is the origin
of your background image.

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440
Here, the image would start right up here.

20
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.256
In this one, in padding-box,
the image would start within the padding.

21
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.390
And in content-box,

22
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.820
the image would actually start 20
pixels from the upper lefthand corner.

23
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.319
Unfortunately, this image failed.

24
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.050
And here we have it, so
we can show it to you.

25
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.620
So let's play it with it
until you get a sense and

26
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.230
you can actually change this to dashed
if that is easier for you to look at.

27
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.542
And let's add a background color.

28
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.180
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, that is hideous.

29
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.660
But we're basically saying
the background-origin

30
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.930
started at the border-box.

31
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.151
Well, why don't we just
start it at padding-box?

32
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.578
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There is no padding.

33
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:27.490
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Why is this not working?

34
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.360
What did I do wrong?

35
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.820
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

36
00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:40.489
I just couldn't see it, okay.

37
00:02:43.612 --> 00:02:47.720
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the background-clip
is basically the background color.

38
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.170
Here I've clipped it at
the end of the padding-box.

39
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.170
Here, I've clipped it nowhere and

40
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.030
here I've clipped it at the content-box.

41
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.251
Now if I take the origin of that image and
I bring it up into the upper left hand

42
00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:08.539
corner by changing it to border, part
of my image is cut off because it's not

43
00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:13.114
actually drawing the background image
where it's not drawing the background.

44
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.930
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Does this
makes sense to people?

45
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.980
So you have background-clip and
background-origin.

46
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.010
The origin,
think of it as an image origin.

47
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.508
And the clip,
think of it as the background color.

48
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:32.605
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
then we have background-size.

49
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.820
And I don't know why I chose something so
hideous.

50
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.430
Yeah, cuz we're making ugly stuff today.

51
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.890
But my side decks are prettier
today than they were yesterday.

52
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.180
So background-size, we have a few values.

53
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.640
We have auto, which is the default.

54
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.498
It's just make the background size
the size that the image was naturally.

55
00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.293
In terms of performance,

56
00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:59.501
that is the fastest because
it doesn't have to,

57
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:04.720
forgot the word for it,
I'll figure out later.

58
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.765
Basically it doesn't have to parse it.

59
00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:08.713
It parses it once and this is the image.

60
00:04:08.713 --> 00:04:12.869
It doesn't have to parse it, recalculate
it, and that is not the right term but

61
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.112
I can't think of the right term right now.

62
00:04:15.112 --> 00:04:19.612
So basically background-size
auto is the natural size of it.

63
00:04:19.612 --> 00:04:21.585
And then you can also say length.

64
00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:27.205
So if I say,
make the background 150 pixels,

65
00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:33.382
well, I basically had
a gradient with a circle in it.

66
00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:37.312
So it's repeating,
the circle's staying the same size.

67
00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:46.121
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And this is a bad example
because the circle is actually growing.

68
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:50.665
We'll do a different one later on.

69
00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:55.529
So basically you're saying I want my
background image to be 140 by 140

70
00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.127
pixels instead of auto.

71
00:04:57.127 --> 00:05:00.263
And so it'll take your 10
pixels by 10 pixels image and

72
00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:03.690
it'll make it 140 pixels by 140 pixels.

73
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.750
If you say I wanna make it
10 pixels by 10 pixels and

74
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.910
it was actually 150 pixels by 150 pixels,
it'll shrink it down.

75
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.691
Then we have two other values
called cover and contain.

76
00:05:17.224 --> 00:05:19.690
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here's a shark.

77
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.489
This was the original
shark from SpeciFISHity.

78
00:05:24.893 --> 00:05:29.030
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
right now, it is auto.

79
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.877
Here, it is contained.

80
00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:39.927
What that means is that I've taken the
image and I've made it fit into the box.

81
00:05:39.927 --> 00:05:43.652
So it will either shrink or grow.

82
00:05:43.652 --> 00:05:47.286
If it was too small,
it would actually go from end to end.

83
00:05:47.286 --> 00:05:51.227
But it will fit one dimension,
whichever dimension, but

84
00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:53.649
it will maintain its aspect ratio.

85
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.970
You can also say cover which will make it
grow to take up at least a 100% of it but

86
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.900
it will maintain in its aspect ratio,
right?

87
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.548
So here, the ends are cut off.

88
00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:11.512
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here, it's shrunk.

89
00:06:11.512 --> 00:06:15.727
However, if it was too small,
it would have actually grown to be bigger.

90
00:06:15.727 --> 00:06:22.310
And then this one says 100 pixels by 200
pixels and I've lost my aspect ratio.

91
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.207
Right?
So you can say if I had just said 100

92
00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:29.302
pixels wide, it would have
maintained its aspect ratio, but

93
00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:34.263
since I declared 2 lengths, the width and
the height, it just listened to

94
00:06:34.263 --> 00:06:39.411
what I had to say and it didn't care what
the original image aspect ratio was.
