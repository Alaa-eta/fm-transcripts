00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:06.430
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Then we have background-clip
and background-origin property.

2
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.080
So the background-clip is where
do you start your background?

3
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.260
So here the background color
on all of these is blue, but

4
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.830
the first one has
the background-clip of content box.

5
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.040
And so, that means the background-color
is just starting in the content box,

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.850
because this has actual padding.

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.580
There's padding from the inside
of the border to the blue area.

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.869
The padding boxes make the content and
the padding have the background.

9
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.102
And the border boxes actually include
the background even underneath the border.

10
00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:48.653
So right here I have a dotted border so
that you can see it, but

11
00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:51.956
normally you would have a solid border,
and

12
00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:55.722
you might actually be
missing part of your image.

13
00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.418
So if you have a border on an element and

14
00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:00.757
you have an image that is supposed to
start in the upper left-hand corner,

15
00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:04.361
you would wanna use padding-box, cuz
otherwise your background is gonna start

16
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:11.556
up there.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: The background

17
00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:14.590
image is missing on this, so
I can't actually show you.

18
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.100
But it's basically the background-origin,

19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.810
it's when you have what is
the origin of your background image?

20
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440
Here, the image would start right up here.

21
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.010
In this one, in padding box, the image
would start within the padding, and

22
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.390
in contact box,

23
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.820
the image would actually start in 20
pixels from the upper left hand corner.

24
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.259
Unfortunately, this image failed.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

25
00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.050
here we have it, so we can show it to you.

26
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.482
So let's play it with it so
you get a sense, and

27
00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:53.269
you can actually change this to
dashed if that is easier for

28
00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:56.466
you to look at.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

29
00:01:56.466 --> 00:02:06.180
let's add a background-color.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, that is hideous.

30
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.930
But we're basically saying the background
origins started at the border box.

31
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.384
Well, why don't we just
start it at padding box?

32
00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:20.814
&gt;&gt; Estelle: There is no padding.

33
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:27.490
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Why is this not working?

34
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.468
Where did I do wrong?
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay.

35
00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:40.545
&gt;&gt; Estelle: All right, I just couldn't see

36
00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:45.673
it, okay.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So, the background-clip is

37
00:02:45.673 --> 00:02:51.170
basically the background-color, here I've
clipped it at the end of the padding box.

38
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.774
Here, I clipped it nowhere, and here,
I clipped it at the content box.

39
00:02:59.774 --> 00:03:03.940
Now, if I take the origin of that image,
and I bring it up into the upper-left-hand

40
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.440
corner by changing it to border,
part of my image is cut off.

41
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.341
Because it's actually drawing the
background image where it's not drawing

42
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.978
the background.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Does this make

43
00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:16.930
sense to people?

44
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.980
So you have background-clip and
background-origin.

45
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.951
The origin, think of it as
an image origin and the clip,

46
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:30.897
think of it as the background color.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay,

47
00:03:30.897 --> 00:03:32.605
then we have background-size.

48
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.820
I don't know why I chose something so
hideous.

49
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.430
Yeah, cuz we're making ugly stuff today.

50
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.082
But my slide decks are prettier
today that they were yesterday.

51
00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:47.640
So background-size, we have a few values,
we have auto which is the default.

52
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.540
It's just make the background-size this
size that the image was naturally.

53
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.615
In terms of performance, that is
the fastest because it doesn't have

54
00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:03.410
to,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I forgot the word for

55
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.990
it, I'll figure it out later.

56
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.270
Basically it doesn't have to parse it,
it parses it once and this is the image.

57
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.320
It doesn't have to parse it, recalculate
it and that is not the right term but

58
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.306
I can't think of the right term right now.

59
00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:18.660
So, basically background-size auto is

60
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.140
the natural size of it, and
then you can also say a length.

61
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.815
So if I make the background 150 pixels,

62
00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:34.400
well, I basically had
a gradient with a circle in it.

63
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.426
So it's repeating,
the circle is staying the same size

64
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.627
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And this is a bad example,

65
00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:50.335
because the circle is actually growing.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: We'll do a different

66
00:04:50.335 --> 00:04:51.690
one later on.

67
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.350
So basically you're saying,

68
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.000
I want my background image to be 140
pixels by 140 pixels instead of auto.

69
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.960
And so it'll take your 10
pixel by 10 pixel image and

70
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.690
it will make it 140 pixels by 140 pixels.

71
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.750
If you say I want to make it
10 pixels by 10 pixels and

72
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.910
it was actually 150 pixels by 150 pixels,
it'll shrink it down.

73
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.679
Then we have two other
values called cover and

74
00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:18.224
contain.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

75
00:05:18.224 --> 00:05:21.914
here's a shark, this was
the original shark from specificity.

76
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.053
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And right now it is auto.

77
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.118
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Here it is contained,

78
00:05:34.118 --> 00:05:39.038
what that means is that
I've taken the image and

79
00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:45.571
I've made it fit into the box,
through either shrink or grow.

80
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:50.026
If it was too small it will actually
go from end to end, but it will fit one

81
00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:54.651
dimension whichever dimension, but
it will maintain its aspect ratio.

82
00:05:54.651 --> 00:06:00.448
You can also say cover, which will make
it grow to take up at least 100% of it,

83
00:06:00.448 --> 00:06:03.900
but it will maintain its aspect ratio,
right?

84
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.971
So here, the ends are cut off.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Here, it's shrunk.

85
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.370
However, if it was too small it would
would have actually grown to be bigger.

86
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.387
And then this was says 100
pixels by 200 pixels and

87
00:06:20.387 --> 00:06:23.045
I've lost my aspect ratio, right?

88
00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:26.494
So you can say,
if I had just said 100 pixels wide,

89
00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:29.340
it would have maintained its aspect ratio.

90
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.345
But since I declared two lengths,
the width and the height, it just listened

91
00:06:34.345 --> 00:06:39.505
to what I had to say and it didn't care
what the original image aspect ratio was.
