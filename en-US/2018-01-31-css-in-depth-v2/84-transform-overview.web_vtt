00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.650
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So transforms.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.420
Who here has done a transform?

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.320
Everyone has done a transform, because
that's a transition that everyone's done.

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.140
Very few people have done transforms.

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.730
Let's go over transforms.

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.014
Okay, so here I'm going to use this
little RSVP sign for everything.

7
00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:27.247
And the reason I said RSVP is because the
last time I did it, I did it with a plane,

8
00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:30.820
and when you'd flip the plane upside down,
you couldn't tell that it was upside down,

9
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.170
cuz it was symmetrical.

10
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.800
But RSVP,
when it's flipped upside down and

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.880
you can't read it, you can really see it.

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.220
So this little logo,
it's generated content on top of the RSVP.

13
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.790
And it's the exact same size,
the exact same font.

14
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.528
Everything's the exact same except for it
has the background color of pale goldenrod

15
00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:52.600
and a greenish-blue weird
color as a drop shadow.

16
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.970
So the original, what it would
look like without the transform,

17
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.300
is always the white one.

18
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.850
The way it looks with
the transform is the goldenrod one.

19
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.640
Or it's actually gold, I'm not sure.

20
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.935
Anyway, so
here I've transformed the letters.

21
00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:10.536
I've translated it -90 pixels and
300 pixels,

22
00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:16.750
which means I've moved it 90 pixels
backwards and 300 pixels down.

23
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.560
Then I've rotated it 50 degrees,
then I've scaled it so it's smaller.

24
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.608
It's 70% of the width and

25
00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:31.817
90% of the height, and
then I've skewed it.

26
00:01:31.817 --> 00:01:33.558
We're gonna go all over those.

27
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:41.500
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's see if I can
just not move it down 300 pixels.

28
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.950
No, I can't edit this one.

29
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.316
So this is how we transform something.

30
00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:50.765
We basically change it by translating it,
rotating it, and skewing it.

31
00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:54.866
You don't have to use all of them,
and the order actually matters.

32
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:59.532
It's basically, the syntax is,
you can either say transform none, or

33
00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:04.214
you can use up to all of these functions,
one or more of these functions.

34
00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:06.234
And there's actually a fifth function,
which we'll cover later.

35
00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:08.301
So what is a support?

36
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:10.670
That looks pretty green, doesn't it?

37
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.627
Let's show all and then go to IE,
cuz that's what we always do.

38
00:02:16.627 --> 00:02:20.771
It starts with IE9, and
with IE9 it was supported with prefix.

39
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:24.116
If you're not supporting IE9 anymore,
don't use a prefix.

40
00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:29.343
I do not know about
the performance with IE9 and

41
00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:34.576
transforms, if it actually
causes a problem.

42
00:02:34.576 --> 00:02:39.521
And the Blackberry 10, since no one
uses it, it doesn't really matter.

43
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:42.541
You don't need to add a web kit prefix for
Blackberry.
