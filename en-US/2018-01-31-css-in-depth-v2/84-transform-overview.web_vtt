00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.593
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So transforms.

2
00:00:03.593 --> 00:00:05.608
Who here has done a transform?

3
00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:12.640
Everyone has done his transform because
that's a transition that everyone's done.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.498
Very few people have done transforms,
let's go over transforms.

5
00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:23.965
Okay, so here I'm gonna use this
little RSVP sign for everything.

6
00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:26.427
And the reason I said RSVP is
because the last time I did it,

7
00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:28.939
I did it with a plane and
when you flip the plane upside down,

8
00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.905
you couldn't tell it was upside down
cuz it was symmetrical but RSVP,

9
00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:35.880
when it's flipped upside down and
you can't read it, you can really see it.

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.610
So this little logo, it's generated
content on top of the RSVP and

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.806
it's the exact same size,
the exact same font.

12
00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:48.110
Everything's the exact same except for it
has the background color of pale goldenrod

13
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.600
and a greenish blue,
weird color as a drop shadow.

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.910
So the original,

15
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.300
what it would look like without
the transform is always the white one.

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.690
The way it looks with the transform is
the goldenrod one or it's actually gold.

17
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.640
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.490
Anyway, so
here I've transformed the letters.

19
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.480
I've translated it -90 pixels and

20
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.750
300 pixels which means I've moved it 90
pixels backwards and 300 pixels down.

21
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.100
Then I've rotated it 50 degrees,
then I've scaled it, so it's smaller.

22
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.575
It's 70% of the width and
90% of the height and then I've skewed it.

23
00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.810
We're gonna go all over those.

24
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.460
Let's see if I can just not move it down
300 pixels, no, I can't edit this one.

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.530
So this is how we transform something.

26
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.000
We basically change it by translating it,
rotating it, and skewing it.

27
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.160
You don't have to use all of them and
the order actually matters.

28
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.480
It's basically the syntax is you
can either say transform none or

29
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.240
you can use up to all of these functions,
one or more of these functions.

30
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.110
And there's actually a fifth
function which we'll cover later.

31
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.040
So what is the support?

32
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.320
That looks pretty green, doesn't it?

33
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.440
Let's show all and then go to
IE cuz that's what we always do.

34
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.810
It starts with IE9 and
with IE9 it was supported with prefix.

35
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.740
If you're not supporting IE9 anymore,
don't use a prefix.

36
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.785
I do not know about
the performance with Microsoft or

37
00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:35.360
IE9 in transforms if it
actually causes a problem.

38
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.365
And the Blackberry 10, since no one
uses it, it doesn't really matter.

39
00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:42.531
You don't need to add a web kit prefix for
Blackberry.
