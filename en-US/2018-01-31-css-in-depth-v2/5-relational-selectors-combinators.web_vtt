00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:05.820
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I wanna talk about
relational selectors and combinators.

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.700
So, as previously mentioned,
there is the descendant selector.

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.260
It's a combinator of a space.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.730
So here, it says ul li.

5
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.770
So it matches every list item that it
is a descendant of an unordered list.

6
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.276
So here on the right-hand side,
we have an ordered list and

7
00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:35.314
nested within that,
we have an unordered list.

8
00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:40.661
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I say ol li,
it matches everything.

9
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:44.412
And so I actually added some opacity, and

10
00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:49.568
you'll see that a, b, and
c were kind of matched twice.

11
00:00:49.568 --> 00:00:54.720
Because the li that is a descendant
of the unordered list,

12
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.860
is also a descendant of the ordered list.

13
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.184
But the ones that are just
a descendant of the ordered list,

14
00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:03.659
only match the first one.

15
00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.506
So I basically put,
it got the color twice.

16
00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.950
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It got
the color twice from just that.

17
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.535
Because it is both a child and
a grandchild.

18
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.795
Here, if I click on ol &gt; li.

19
00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:31.161
That means just the list
items that are a descendant,

20
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.630
I mean a child of the ordered list.

21
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.675
So why is a, b, and c gray?

22
00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:44.066
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because it actually
is nested within a gray parent,

23
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.010
which is the parent li.

24
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.974
So that parent li has been
targeted as being gray, and so

25
00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:51.510
the whole thing has
a background of being gray.

26
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.981
It's not those individual items
that then were also targeted.

27
00:01:57.912 --> 00:02:00.870
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then there's
the adjacent sibling selector.

28
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.260
So number 4 has a class of hasaclass.

29
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.354
I should come up with better names.

30
00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:14.580
This selector right here says,
find the li that comes immediately after.

31
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.204
Basically having the same parent,
it's nested in the same parent.

32
00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:22.709
It comes immediately after
an li that has a class

33
00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.530
of,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That

34
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.165
has a class of hasaclass.

35
00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:32.313
That's why I should've named it
something different, cuz I said that and

36
00:02:32.313 --> 00:02:33.740
then I'm like, what did I just say?

37
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.200
That's considered the adjacent
sibling selector.

38
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.660
So let me see if I can get rid of this,
no, I can't.

39
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.802
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

40
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:51.158
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I have a small problem,
which is the last one is not visible and

41
00:02:51.158 --> 00:02:52.770
it has a tilde.

42
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.602
So instead of the + right here,
it has a tilde.

43
00:02:57.602 --> 00:03:01.130
The tilde is the general sibling selector.

44
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.811
So the general sibling selector,
which was new in IE7,

45
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:12.386
so it's not new anymore,
targets the element.

46
00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:18.744
So if it said li.hasaclass ~ li,
it means match any li that comes after,

47
00:03:18.744 --> 00:03:25.012
not immediately after but just generally
after, an li that has a class.

48
00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:30.218
So here number 4 has a class and
5, 6, and 7 are general siblings.

49
00:03:30.218 --> 00:03:33.018
They're not the adjacent sibling,
which is the plus sign.

50
00:03:33.018 --> 00:03:36.375
They are the tilde,
which is the general sibling.

51
00:03:40.383 --> 00:03:42.804
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Just so you know
how I actually did that JavaScript,

52
00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:44.630
I used the selectors API.

53
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.916
And I, basically,
the reason I'm pointing this out is,

54
00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:51.619
in JavaScript you can say
querySelector and querySelectorAll.

55
00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:58.783
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And target, you can put
any CSS selector that we cover today,

56
00:03:58.783 --> 00:04:02.670
you can put in there and
target that element.

57
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.990
The first one comes back
with just the first element.

58
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.930
The second one, which is querySelectorAll,
comes back with all of the elements.

59
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.995
And then you can do something,
you see this is a little bit more complex.

60
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:20.441
It says find me all the elements
that have the class of foo that

61
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:22.740
are a descendant of bar.

62
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.228
And you can actually get
much more complex than this.

63
00:04:26.228 --> 00:04:27.363
You can put,

64
00:04:36.024 --> 00:04:41.970
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Any descendent of
bar that also has a type attribute.

65
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.419
So you can put anything in there and

66
00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.739
you can use JavaScript to find
those elements if you need to.

67
00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:53.211
And so I basically used the selectors
API with the classList,

68
00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:58.199
which is a feature in JavaScript as well,
to add and remove classes.

69
00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.127
And that's how I did the JavaScript
that selected those.

70
00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:04.709
So I want you to think about the fact
that you can remove and add classes.

71
00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:10.683
And have querySelector and
querySelectorAll in your JS and

72
00:05:10.683 --> 00:05:15.230
add and remove classes and
target elements.
