&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: AlphaTransparency is
what we've been talking about so far,

2
00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:10.630
which is changing the color, right,
your color is not fully opaque.

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.410
And that is the color of
some foreground element.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.620
So here, we have the color is black.

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.640
And then the background color
is some form of orange.

6
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.254
No, some form of blue.

7
00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:31.632
I've no clue cuz background color
all looks white to me and so,

8
00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:33.814
I think I should have read border color.

9
00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:38.014
And so I basically get more and
more transparent as I go by but

10
00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:41.965
it's actually the color that
is getting transparent.

11
00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:45.251
The thing itself is still white, right?

12
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:49.014
Because if it wasn't white,
if the background color wasn't white,

13
00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:51.520
fully opaque,
you'd see what was behind it.

14
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.165
When you have opacity,

15
00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:57.702
it's actually the whole element
that is becoming transparent.

16
00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:00.005
So here the top one is opacity 1.

17
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:04.827
The second one is opacity 75%,
opacity 50%, opacity 25%, and

18
00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:09.830
the one that has opacity 0, you can't
see that there was a div there at all.

19
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.660
Because the whole thing became fully the
opposite of opaque, which is transparent.

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.690
Here, you still have the white
because only the color of the shadow,

21
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.960
it should be shadow color, and
the color of the text became transparent.

22
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.380
But you still have
the shadow on that text, and

23
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.270
you still have the background
that is fully opaque.

24
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.450
Here, the text, the shadow,
the background,

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.890
all of it became transparent because
the opacity was set on the element.

26
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.880
And everything went to transparent.

27
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.700
So that's the difference between
AlphaTransparency and opacity.

28
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.670
Which really doesn't make it that much of
a difference in your life until you get

29
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.430
stuck on like,
explaining it to someone, basically.

30
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.250
So AlphaTransparency tips,
transparent shadows are awesome.

31
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.060
Instead of using a value like CCC for
a gray shadow, which is, or 999,

32
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.190
which is the one on the bottom.

33
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.950
Use something like transparent
RGBA with 0.3 or 0.2.

34
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.360
Because then you can see
stuff in the background,

35
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.220
especially if it's over an image or
something with changing colors.

36
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.253
This looks completely artificial, and
this looks very natural on top of stuff.
