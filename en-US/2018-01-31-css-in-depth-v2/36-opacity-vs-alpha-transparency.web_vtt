what we've been talking about so

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.030
far which is changing the color, right?

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.410
Your color is not fully opaque, and that
is the color of some fore ground element.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.620
So here we have the color is black.

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.640
And then the background color
is some form of orange?

6
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.690
No, it's some form of blue.

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.330
I've no clue cause background
color all looks white to me and so

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.768
I think I should have read border color.

9
00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:38.402
And so I basically can get more and
more transparent as I go by, but

10
00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:41.789
its actually the color
that gets transparent.

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.050
The thing itself is still white,
right, because if

12
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
the background color wasn't white, fully
opaque, you'd see what was behind it.

13
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.240
When you have opacity,

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.830
it's actually the whole element
that is becoming transparent.

15
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.790
So here the top one is opacity one,
The second is opacity 75%.

16
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.410
Opacity 50%, opacity 25%, and
the one that has opacity 0,

17
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.830
you can't see that there
was a dim there at all.

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.660
Because the whole thing became fully the
opposite of opaque which is transparent.

19
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.690
Here you still have the white because
only the color of the shadow.

20
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.060
It should be shadow color, and the color
of the text became transparent but

21
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.200
you still have the shadow on that text.

22
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.270
And you still have the background
that is full opaque.

23
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.180
Here the text, the shadow, the background,
all of it became transparent because

24
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.880
the opacity was set on the element,
and everything went to transparent.

25
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.700
So that's the difference between
alpha transparency and opacity.

26
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.670
Which really doesn't make that much of
a difference in your life until you get

27
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.430
stuck on explaining it to someone,
basically.

28
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.120
So alpha transparency tips.

29
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.250
Transparent shadows are awesome.

30
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.060
Instead of using a value like CCC for
a grey shadow, which is what their 999,

31
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.170
which is the one on the bottom.

32
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.950
Used something like transparent
RGBA with 0.3 or 0.2.

33
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.360
Because then you can see
stuff in the background.

34
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.220
Especially if it's over an image or
something with changing colors.

35
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.719
This looks completely artificial, and
this looks very natural on top of stuff.
