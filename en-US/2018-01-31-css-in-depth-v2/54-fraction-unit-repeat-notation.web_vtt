00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:10.830
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, here,
I have a more complicated grid.

2
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.124
And it says grid-template-columns, repeat
twice 2frs, then repeat three times 1fr.

3
00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:22.643
So column 3, 4, and 5,
are half the width of 1 and

4
00:00:22.643 --> 00:00:28.244
2, and column 6 is 3frs.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then grid template

5
00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:34.113
row, the first one is 2frs,
then the second one is 125,

6
00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:38.963
these are both 4Ms, and
these are not declared.

7
00:00:38.963 --> 00:00:45.030
So why is row number 1 so tiny?

8
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.530
Anyone have a guess?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I had no free space.

9
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.682
Fr is basically 0.

10
00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:01.004
These last lines aren't actually declared.

11
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:05.371
I could have actually said 6fr.

12
00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:12.536
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you have 2fr, 125,

13
00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:15.732
4m, 4m, and 6fr.

14
00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:17.333
So my fr was basically tiny,

15
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:22.588
it was a few pixels.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's the free space

16
00:01:22.588 --> 00:01:27.520
that's right there.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So like 2 pixels.

17
00:01:28.592 --> 00:01:34.262
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Lets make it 5,

18
00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:37.505
4, 3.

19
00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:40.909
Doesn't look very good when I do that so
I should make it- Okay.

20
00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.476
Okay so fr,
the term is actually fraction unit and

21
00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:49.951
it describes a fraction
of the available space.

22
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:55.289
So that's that extra space within
the height in that case or

23
00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:02.041
the width that can be divided equally
based on how much space is available.

24
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:07.601
And then the repeat, I think you've have
a good understanding of what to repeat is.

25
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:12.959
So, let's go back here, and
I'm gonna give you two minutes

26
00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.124
to just play with it and
write your own widths and heights.

27
00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:29.432
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Keep playing with it but

28
00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:33.190
grid-template-columns and
grid-template-rows,

29
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.521
that's one of those things that you're
never gonna remember how to write that.

30
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:41.340
But at least now you know what it is so
you can look it up.

31
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.527
I still look it up every single time.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's

32
00:02:47.527 --> 00:02:51.072
why I kept copying and pasting it,
because what's that damn word?

33
00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:05.557
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The other thing that's

34
00:03:05.557 --> 00:03:10.762
really important is the fact
that you can mix the units.

35
00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:14.717
So if you want your aside
to be 200 pixels, and

36
00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:19.250
you're nav on the other side
to to be 200 pixels, and

37
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.880
the thing in the middle to be
whatever size it needs to be,

38
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.080
you can say a min of something and 1fr.

39
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.767
So basically take all the free space but

40
00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:34.900
at least something wide.

41
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:52.874
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here,

42
00:03:52.874 --> 00:03:57.791
I actually added, we're gonna cover
this in a second, I added the min and

43
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.472
max for the last column.

44
00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:15.342
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And here what I did
is I made it wider than the window.

45
00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:19.614
I basically said I want
the first two to be 200 pixels,

46
00:05:19.614 --> 00:05:25.401
this next three to be 150 pixels, and
that just didn't fit on the screen.

47
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:29.741
And then the last one, either to be
a minimum or maximum of 10 pixels, so

48
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:32.132
it's gonna be a minimum of 10 pixels.

49
00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:37.741
But I could say a minimum of 100 pixels,
and a maximum of 1fr.

50
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:41.219
And if I don't have any fr units, fr is 0.

51
00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.392
It's gonna make it 100 pixels.

52
00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:46.402
Okay, so let's continue.

53
00:05:46.402 --> 00:05:51.470
So as you saw, we've been using some
different units for those widths.

54
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.033
Generally, we use the fr unit,
and a length or

55
00:05:56.033 --> 00:06:00.479
percentage, but you can say max-content,

56
00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.398
which is in flex box and
in grid, and everything.

57
00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.243
Your element has content in it.

58
00:06:07.243 --> 00:06:11.061
Right now we just have the number 1, so

59
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:15.583
max content and
main content it's just tiny.

60
00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:22.549
But it can be relative content or it can
be minmax which is a size between the min.

61
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:27.384
If max is less than min,
then max is ignored,

62
00:06:27.384 --> 00:06:30.581
and minmax is treated as min.

63
00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:35.975
Or it can be auto, and let's go and
add auto, or it can be fit content which

64
00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:41.636
is basically a calculation of the content,
the length, or the percentage.

65
00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:46.254
So if we just do here auto,

66
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.476
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I meant to put it here,

67
00:06:58.476 --> 00:07:00.262
that's why it didn't work.

68
00:07:00.262 --> 00:07:05.131
It basically says I only need
to be the size of the text.

69
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:11.753
But if I do first-child,

70
00:07:11.753 --> 00:07:15.967
it's shorter.

71
00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:23.586
And I do before
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Content.

72
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.881
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Auto became much bigger,

73
00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:34.679
right?

74
00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:37.797
Because I have content in there.
