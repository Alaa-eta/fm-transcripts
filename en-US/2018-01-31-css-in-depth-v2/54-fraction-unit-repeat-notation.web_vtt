00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:09.600
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here,
I have a more complicated grid.

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.100
And it says grid-template-columns repeat
twice, 2frs, then repeat three times, 1fr.

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.704
So column 3, 4 and 5 are half the width
of 1 and 2, and column 6 is three frs.

4
00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:27.392
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then grid template row,

5
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:31.781
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The first one is 2frs,

6
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:37.810
then the second one is 125, these
are both 4ms, and these are not declared.

7
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.754
So why is row number 1 so
tiny, anyone have a guess?

8
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:54.252
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I have no free space,
so fr is basically zero.

9
00:00:54.252 --> 00:01:00.972
I could have made these last
lines aren't actually declared.

10
00:01:00.972 --> 00:01:02.811
I could have actually said 6fr.

11
00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:10.910
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you have 2fr,

12
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.652
125, 4em and 6 fr.

13
00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:18.615
So my fr was basically
tiny little few pixels.

14
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:23.148
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's in a free
space that's right there.

15
00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:26.282
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So like two pixels.

16
00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:33.638
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So make it 5,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 4,

17
00:01:36.277 --> 00:01:37.321
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 3, it doesn't

18
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:40.906
look very good when I do that,
so I should make it; okay.

19
00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:45.644
Okay so, fr is the term is
actually fraction unit, and

20
00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:49.867
it describes a fraction
of the available space.

21
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:55.134
So that's that extra space
within the height, in that case,

22
00:01:55.134 --> 00:02:01.943
or the width, that can be divided equally
based on how much space is available.

23
00:02:01.943 --> 00:02:07.467
And then the repeat, I think you have a
good understanding of what the repeat is.

24
00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:12.163
So let's go back here and I'm gonna give
you two minutes to just play with it and

25
00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:14.379
write your own widths and heighths.

26
00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:21.019
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And you can,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.

27
00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:29.071
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the thing is,
keep playing with it, but

28
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:32.905
grid-template-columns and
grid-template-rows,

29
00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:38.350
that's one of those things that you're
never gonna remember how to write that.

30
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.139
But at least now you know what it is so
you can look it up,

31
00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.031
I still look it up every single time.

32
00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:49.813
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's why I kept copying
and pasting it cuz I'm kinda like.

33
00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:08.189
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The other thing
that's really important is the fact

34
00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.698
that you can mix the units.

35
00:03:10.698 --> 00:03:16.154
So if you want your aside to be 200
pixels, and your nav on the other side to

36
00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:21.894
be 200 pixels, and the thing in the middle
to be whatever size it needs to be?

37
00:03:21.894 --> 00:03:26.974
You can set a min of something, and 1fr.

38
00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:31.082
So basically, taking the all the free
space, but at least something wide.

39
00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:56.354
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here I actually added
we're gonna cover this in a second,

40
00:03:56.354 --> 00:03:59.352
I added the min and
max for the last column.

41
00:05:10.617 --> 00:05:15.321
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And here, what I did
is I made it wider than the window.

42
00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:20.275
I basically said, I want the first
two to be 200 pixels this next

43
00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:25.328
three to be 150 pixels, and
that just didn't fit on the screen.

44
00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:29.293
And then the last one, either to be
a minimum or maximum of ten pixels, so

45
00:05:29.293 --> 00:05:32.040
it's gonna be a minimum of ten pixels.

46
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.723
But I could say minimum of 100 pixels and

47
00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:40.221
a maximum of 1fr, and
if I don't have any fr units,

48
00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:44.860
fr is 0,
it's gonna make it 100 pixels, okay.

49
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.050
So, let's continue, so, as you saw we've
been using some different units for

50
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.740
those widths.

51
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.859
Generally we use the fr unit and
the length of percentage,

52
00:05:56.859 --> 00:06:01.643
but you can say max content,
which is, In Flexbox and

53
00:06:01.643 --> 00:06:07.192
in GRID, and in everything,
your element has content in it.

54
00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:13.712
Right now we just have the number one, so
max content and min content is just tiny.

55
00:06:13.712 --> 00:06:16.677
But it can be relative to the content, or

56
00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:20.700
it can be min, max,
which is the size between the min.

57
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.662
If max is less than min
then max is ignored and

58
00:06:27.662 --> 00:06:30.556
min max is treated as min.

59
00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:35.763
Or it could be auto, and let's go and
add auto, or it could be fit content,

60
00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:41.571
which is basically a calculation of the
content, the length, or the percentage.

61
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:45.064
So, if we just do here, auto,

62
00:06:57.152 --> 00:06:58.371
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I meant to put it here,

63
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:00.480
that is why it didn't work.

64
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.333
It's basically says I'm gonna
need to be the size of the text.

65
00:07:05.084 --> 00:07:10.288
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: But
if I do, li first of type or

66
00:07:10.288 --> 00:07:15.912
I can just first child shorter,

67
00:07:15.912 --> 00:07:18.840
and I do before.

68
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.813
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Content.

69
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:36.120
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Auto became much bigger,
right, because I have content in there.
