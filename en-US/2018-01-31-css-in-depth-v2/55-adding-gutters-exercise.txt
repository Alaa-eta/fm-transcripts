>> Estelle Weyl: So, let's talk about adding the gutters. So far I've added gutters I believe or no did I not. I added gutters to make it look better, but I didn't tell you about it because this is what it looks like without gutters, right? That's ugly. One of the nice things that we always, you don't have to worry about margins.

[00:00:23]
You always have the same amount of margins between cells. It's really nice to have a nice layout with good white space. White space makes websites much more readable. So instead of saying, here's a paragraph of text, and I want padding here and then margins. You can just say, well, there's gonna be 20 pixels between any element, so it's going to be legible.

[00:00:44]
Okay, so,
>> Estelle Weyl: We have three properties. We have the grid-column-gap, the grid-row-gap, and then just the shorthand, which is the grid-gap.
>> Estelle Weyl: And Margin does actually still work. On these, so let's go over here and play with it. So when I save grid row, it's between each row.

[00:01:15]
When I save column gap, it's between the columns. When I undo this one right here, it's gonna be the exact same. Because the order is row, and then column. So top to bottom, left right. Which makes it less confusing than when we were doing the tables. Okay, so here let's just make it 40 pixels and then 10.

[00:01:47]
And that might make you realize why you probably just wanna do just one number overall for column gap cause that looks much better, right? Having it even. You can use different units, right? One m instead but let's actually put margin on one of these. Li nth-of-type(3) {margin: 20 px;.

[00:02:19]
So margin still works.
>> Estelle Weyl: Box-sizing: border-box,
>> Estelle Weyl: I just wanted to see what that did and then we can put padding,
>> Estelle Weyl: 30 pixels.
>> Estelle Weyl: And it just changed the whole layout of the page.
>> Estelle Weyl: Because the FR unit is now a different length, right. Before it maintained the same length, but then now that I have added padding that element is much bigger.

[00:02:57]
With between the margin and the padding the element got much bigger, which shrank the amount of free space. Okay, so what I want you to do over the next five minutes is to create a grid. So there's a little thing here, it says, try it out. And I want you to create a grid container with the display property.

[00:03:20]
I want you to create the columns and the rows with either, or grid template area. But we didn't go grid template area so just forget there's an or here and the word either. Then optional added gutter with grid gap or column
