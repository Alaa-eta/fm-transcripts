[00:00:01]
>> Steve Kinney: So remember the counters? Here's a counter again. Can anyone tell me what this does?
>> Steve Kinney: I mean, we didn't even have that many carbs for lunch, come on.
>> Steve Kinney: Okay, so-
>> Speaker 2: When you load the page, it resets the counter?
>> Steve Kinney: Exactly, yeah. Whenever it hits a body, and there's only one body, it resets the counter.

[00:00:26]
Generally, I wouldn't have even needed that, cuz it basically also creates the counter. The next one, what does this do? What does that match?
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Steve Kinney: Exactly, anything that's invalid which is generally an input. And what does it do when it hits that invalid input?
>> Speaker 3: Increases the counter.

[00:00:54]

>> Steve Kinney: It increases the counter with the name invalidCount I could have any number of counters on this page. Just give each counter a unique name and then you can go with it. And then, here I print it to the page. So I print the invalid count counter. And so whenever,

[00:01:25]

>> Steve Kinney: Whenever it encounters something that's invalid, it actually knows that. I know you understand that. So, here's another example, and this is the one I was hoping you would play with. So
>> Steve Kinney: The reason I have, okay. So let's just look at the syntax here. So here I have two quotes and then the counter.

[00:01:54]
So the reason I have two quotes is because I have a space there because I don't want it to look like that. So you quote the strings.
>> Steve Kinney: And so I could do paragraphs,
>> Steve Kinney: And then I could do that and then I go do r.
>> Steve Kinney: Right, and then I could continue, I could have, it doesn't matter how many quoted strings.

[00:02:29]
The thing to note is it's not interpolated. It is just presented as a string.
>> Steve Kinney: Okay, so if you see in the bottom left hand corner, I somehow broke my counter. Because I'm still on slider number 3, right there.
>> Steve Kinney: So there's something wrong with my counter, because it says number 4, and then every time I move over it just goes back to number 3.

[00:03:00]
So what I'm doing, the way I'm making my slide deck work is, each slide has the class of slide. And then there's far past, past, current, future, and far future. And I think what I'm doing is I'm removing the slide class from the slide because I pulled out a JavaScript and I think pulled an old version of this JavaScript which created these a different way.

[00:03:30]
So the way the slide is created, it actually toggles the slide class on and of every time it gets a class of either far past, past, current, future, far future. Those are the only ones with the slide class. Actually no, it's not that. It's all of the other that have a display of none.

[00:03:51]
So they don't exist, and so they're not being counted. It's one of those two things that are happening. Either I'm removing the slide class from those or it's display none, so it's not being counted. And that's why there's just one through five in this deck, and that's all you're ever going to see.

[00:04:08]
And I'm pretty sure it's not counting the display none, which is the reason. Cuz I'm not sure which JavaScript I used.
