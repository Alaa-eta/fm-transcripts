[00:00:02]
>> Estelle Weyl: So remember the counters? Here's a counter again. Can anyone tell me what this does?
>> Estelle Weyl: I mean, we didn't even have that many carbs for lunch, come on.
>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so-
>> Speaker 2: When you load the page, it resets the counter?
>> Estelle Weyl: Exactly, yeah. Whenever it hits a body, and there's only one body, it resets the counter.

[00:00:26]
All right, generally I wouldn't even need that because it basically also creates the counter. The next one, what does this do? What does that match?
>> Speaker 3: Invalid input.
>> Estelle Weyl: Exactly, anything that's invalid, which is generally an input. And what does it do when it hits that invalid input?

[00:00:51]

>> Speaker 3: Increases the counter?
>> Estelle Weyl: It increases the counter with the name invalidCount. I could have any number of counters on this page. Just give each counter a unique name, and then you can go with it.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then here, I print it to the page. So I print the invalidCount counter.

[00:01:25]

>> Estelle Weyl: Whenever it encounters something that's invalid, it actually does that. I know you understand that, here's another example. And this is the one I was hoping you would play with.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so let's just look at the syntax here. So here, I have two quotes, and then the counter.

[00:01:54]
So the reason I have two quotes is because I have a space there, because I don't want it to look like that. So you quote the strings.
>> Estelle Weyl: And so I could do paragraphs.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then I could do that. And then I could do are, right? And then I could continue, doesn't matter, how many quoted strings.

[00:02:29]
The thing to note is, it's not interpolated, it is just presented as a string.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so If you see in the bottom left-hand corner, I somehow broke my counter because I'm still on slider number three. Right there.
>> Estelle Weyl: So there's something wrong with my counter because it says number four.

[00:02:56]
And then every time I move over, it just goes back to number three. So the way I am making my slide deck work is each slide has the class of slide. And then there's far past, past, current, future, and far-future. And I think what I'm doing is I'm removing the slide class from the slide.

[00:03:23]
Because I pulled out of JavaScript, and I think I pulled out an old version of this JavaScript, which created these a different way. So the way the slide is created, it toggles the slide class on and off every time it gets a class of either past-past, current, future, far-future, those are the only ones with the slide class, actually no, it's not that.

[00:03:49]
It's all of the others who have a display of none, so they don't exist, and so they're not being counted. It's one of those two things that are happening. Either I'm removing the slide class from those, or it's display, none, so it's not being counted. And that's why there's just one through five in this deck, and that's all you're ever going to see.

[00:04:08]
And I'm pretty sure it's not counting the display, none, which is the reason, cuz I'm not sure which JavaScript I used.
