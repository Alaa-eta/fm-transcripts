00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.452
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So remember the counters?

2
00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:06.267
Here's a counter again.

3
00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:10.239
Can anyone tell me what this does?

4
00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.844
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I mean, we didn't even
have that many carbs for lunch, come on.

5
00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.154
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When you load the page,

6
00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:21.065
it resets the counter?

7
00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:22.998
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Exactly, yeah.

8
00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:26.885
Whenever it hits a body, and there's
only one body, it resets the counter.

9
00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:30.498
Generally, I wouldn't
have even needed that,

10
00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:33.767
cuz it basically also creates the counter.

11
00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:37.032
The next one, what does this do?

12
00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:38.000
What does that match?

13
00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:43.348
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Exactly,

14
00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:47.785
anything that's invalid
which is generally an input.

15
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:52.727
And what does it do when
it hits that invalid input?

16
00:00:52.727 --> 00:00:54.109
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Increases the counter.

17
00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.606
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It increases the counter
with the name invalidCount I could have

18
00:00:58.606 --> 00:01:01.196
any number of counters on this page.

19
00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:05.955
Just give each counter a unique name and

20
00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:08.844
then you can go with it.

21
00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:12.629
And then, here I print it to the page.

22
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:17.239
So I print the invalid count counter.

23
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.113
And so whenever,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Whenever

24
00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:30.630
it encounters something that's invalid,
it actually knows that.

25
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.490
I know you understand that.

26
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.350
So, here's another example, and this is
the one I was hoping you would play with.

27
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.370
So
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The reason I have, okay.

28
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.740
So let's just look at the syntax here.

29
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.813
So here I have two quotes and
then the counter.

30
00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:59.334
So the reason I have two quotes
is because I have a space

31
00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:03.466
there because I don't want
it to look like that.

32
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.488
So you quote the strings.

33
00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:08.766
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And so

34
00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:16.087
I could do paragraphs,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

35
00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:20.209
then I could do that and then I go do r.

36
00:02:22.764 --> 00:02:26.460
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, and
then I could continue, I could have,

37
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.812
it doesn't matter how many quoted strings.

38
00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:32.159
The thing to note is
it's not interpolated.

39
00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.119
It is just presented as a string.

40
00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:41.907
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so
if you see in the bottom left hand corner,

41
00:02:41.907 --> 00:02:44.210
I somehow broke my counter.

42
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.320
Because I'm still on slider number 3,
right there.

43
00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:55.182
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So there's something
wrong with my counter, because it

44
00:02:55.182 --> 00:03:00.780
says number 4, and then every time I
move over it just goes back to number 3.

45
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.350
So what I'm doing,
the way I'm making my slide deck work is,

46
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.360
each slide has the class of slide.

47
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.900
And then there's far past, past,
current, future, and far future.

48
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.420
And I think what I'm doing is I'm
removing the slide class from

49
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.975
the slide because I pulled out
a JavaScript and I think pulled an old

50
00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:30.467
version of this JavaScript which
created these a different way.

51
00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:37.581
So the way the slide is created,
it actually toggles the slide class on and

52
00:03:37.581 --> 00:03:42.169
of every time it gets
a class of either far past,

53
00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.092
past, current, future, far future.

54
00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.920
Those are the only ones
with the slide class.

55
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.230
Actually no, it's not that.

56
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.840
It's all of the other that
have a display of none.

57
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.790
So they don't exist, and so
they're not being counted.

58
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.491
It's one of those two
things that are happening.

59
00:03:56.491 --> 00:04:00.798
Either I'm removing the slide class
from those or it's display none,

60
00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:02.535
so it's not being counted.

61
00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:06.480
And that's why there's just one
through five in this deck, and

62
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.907
that's all you're ever going to see.

63
00:04:08.907 --> 00:04:13.299
And I'm pretty sure it's not counting
the display none, which is the reason.

64
00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.706
Cuz I'm not sure which JavaScript I used.
