00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.385
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So remember the counters?

2
00:00:03.385 --> 00:00:06.193
Here's a counter again.

3
00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:10.177
Can anyone tell me what this does?

4
00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:16.861
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I mean, we didn't even
have that many carbs for lunch, come on.

5
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:19.133
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so-

6
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.013
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When you load the page,

7
00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:20.893
it resets the counter?

8
00:00:20.893 --> 00:00:22.589
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Exactly, yeah.

9
00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.229
Whenever it hits a body, and there's
only one body, it resets the counter.

10
00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:30.587
All right, generally I wouldn't
even need that because

11
00:00:30.587 --> 00:00:33.682
it basically also creates the counter.

12
00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:36.930
The next one, what does this do?

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.587
What does that match?

14
00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:42.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Invalid input.

15
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.657
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Exactly, anything that's
invalid, which is generally an input.

16
00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:51.919
And what does it do when
it hits that invalid input?

17
00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:54.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Increases the counter?

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.824
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It increases
the counter with the name invalidCount.

19
00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.083
I could have any number
of counters on this page.

20
00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:04.803
Just give each counter a unique name,
and then you can go with it.

21
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.508
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then here,
I print it to the page.

22
00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:17.300
So I print the invalidCount counter.

23
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:28.849
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Whenever it
encounters something that's invalid,

24
00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:30.350
it actually does that.

25
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.124
I know you understand that,
here's another example.

26
00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:38.484
And this is the one I was
hoping you would play with.

27
00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:49.514
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
let's just look at the syntax here.

28
00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:54.723
So here, I have two quotes,
and then the counter.

29
00:01:54.723 --> 00:01:59.831
So the reason I have two quotes
is because I have a space there,

30
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:03.377
because I don't want it to look like that.

31
00:02:03.377 --> 00:02:04.983
So you quote the strings.

32
00:02:08.054 --> 00:02:11.950
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And so
I could do paragraphs.

33
00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:18.484
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then I could do that.

34
00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:23.868
And then I could do are, right?

35
00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:29.695
And then I could continue,
doesn't matter, how many quoted strings.

36
00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:32.221
The thing to note is,
it's not interpolated,

37
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.001
it is just presented as a string.

38
00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:42.344
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
If you see in the bottom left-hand corner,

39
00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:48.397
I somehow broke my counter because
I'm still on slider number three.

40
00:02:48.397 --> 00:02:49.349
Right there.

41
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:55.843
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So there's something
wrong with my counter because it says

42
00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:56.848
number four.

43
00:02:56.848 --> 00:03:00.215
And then every time I move over,
it just goes back to number three.

44
00:03:00.215 --> 00:03:04.194
So the way I am making my slide deck

45
00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:09.178
work is each slide has the class of slide.

46
00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:13.945
And then there's far past, past, current,

47
00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:16.885
future, and far-future.

48
00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:23.816
And I think what I'm doing is I'm
removing the slide class from the slide.

49
00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:27.781
Because I pulled out of JavaScript, and I
think I pulled out an old version of this

50
00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:30.365
JavaScript, which created
these a different way.

51
00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:35.765
So the way the slide is created,
it toggles the slide class on and

52
00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:40.165
off every time it gets
a class of either past-past,

53
00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:45.065
current, future, far-future,
those are the only ones

54
00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:49.979
with the slide class,
actually no, it's not that.

55
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.450
It's all of the others who have a display
of none, so they don't exist, and so

56
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.779
they're not being counted.

57
00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:56.240
It's one of those two
things that are happening.

58
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.890
Either I'm removing the slide class
from those, or it's display, none, so

59
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.447
it's not being counted.

60
00:04:02.447 --> 00:04:06.322
And that's why there's just one
through five in this deck, and

61
00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:08.707
that's all you're ever going to see.

62
00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:13.037
And I'm pretty sure it's not counting
the display, none, which is the reason,

63
00:04:13.037 --> 00:04:15.320
cuz I'm not sure which JavaScript I used.
