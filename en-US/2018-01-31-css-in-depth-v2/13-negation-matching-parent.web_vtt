00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:06.566
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay so let's cover
some other logical combinators including

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.464
negation, which you've seen me use,
matching, and parent.

3
00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.732
You've seen me type this a few times,
what does it mean?

4
00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:15.361
:not.

5
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:21.347
It means not whatever is
inside the parentheses.

6
00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:28.742
So this matches any element
that is not also matched by s1.

7
00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:32.140
s1 is a selector., and
it's a simple selector.

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.430
By simple selector,
I don't mean easy selector, like

9
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.360
E space F, that's actually a combinator,
no combinators.

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.810
A simple selector is like
nth of type 27 n plus 3.

11
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.430
That's a simple selector.

12
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.704
There's no spaces, there's no combinators.

13
00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:57.219
So you can say if you
want to do everything but

14
00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.441
the first five with items,
you could do E not first of type E,

15
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:07.729
not second of type or nth of type, right?

16
00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.981
So that would be one way of doing it.

17
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:14.982
So it basically matches any div that

18
00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:20.659
does not have the class that exclude me.

19
00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.726
So it basically excludes everything
that says it has a class of excluding.

20
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.685
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So specificity,

21
00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:32.740
the specificity of not is it
doesn't have any specific weight.

22
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.160
The not itself does not
have any specificity.

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.649
Whatever is inside there is
what gives it the weight.

24
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.478
So here the .excludeMe,
you would have 010 for

25
00:01:44.478 --> 00:01:50.414
the exclude me, and 001 for
the div, so that would be a 011.

26
00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:56.636
If this had been a pound sign, right,

27
00:01:56.636 --> 00:02:01.973
it would be,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 101,

28
00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:07.343
because 100 for the ID, and 001 for

29
00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:11.494
the div, does that make sense?

30
00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:13.681
Okay,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

31
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:19.425
it's been supported for a long time.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Not supportive yet

32
00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:22.513
or just in Safari is saying many things.

33
00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:23.840
So you can put a list of things.

34
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.668
So we could have done
E not nth of type 1 or

35
00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:33.390
nth only of type, that kind of stuff.

36
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.940
Still they have to simple selectors so
no combinators within them, but

37
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.990
you can put as many as you want and
that will be supported,

38
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.220
Safari is supporting it already.

39
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.111
So div, it will match any div except for

40
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:50.396
the ones that have either
the classes excludeMe or excuseYou.

41
00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:55.213
You could also have written for right now,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You can

42
00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:59.157
do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And string them together,

43
00:02:59.157 --> 00:03:05.573
that works.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So let's take 60 seconds

44
00:03:05.573 --> 00:03:09.440
to just play with this, play with it on
your own but I'm gonna do it up here.

45
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.590
So all of them have the color
blue to start with.

46
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.014
And then also I'm gonna change
the color red, except for

47
00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:28.124
if it's the first child,
which would also be the first of type.

48
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:32.889
And here I can put,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: nth

49
00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.022
of type,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 2n.

50
00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:40.563
And that actually matches then every,

51
00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:45.108
I basically said don't match any
even ones, just match the odd ones.

52
00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:49.377
And then I could do +1 here,
and it still matches.

53
00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:56.890
But I could not do LI that is a child with
an LI because that has a space in it and

54
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.304
that means that it is
a complex selector even

55
00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:06.360
though it's a really easy selector, right?

56
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.920
An LI that is the descendant
of an unordered LI or

57
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.120
that is a definite of an ordered list.

58
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.433
So you'd think that that would
say any LI except for the ones.

59
00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:22.280
That is the child of an unordered list but
that is complex selector,

60
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.997
not a simple selector.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

61
00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:32.241
you can actually put
an attribute in there so

62
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:37.919
we could say not,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's a link within a so

63
00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.240
I can't do that.

64
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.360
Not.

65
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.130
So let's just do
:not(:nth-of-type(3n)) and

66
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.500
then I need to add one more there.

67
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.530
Okay, so let's go on to the next one.

68
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.854
Now that you've played
with that a little bit.

69
00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:03.702
[COUGH] We don't have matches yet
I don't believe,

70
00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:12.280
but matches is going to be cool because
it will match a whole slew of things.

71
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.322
So you can say LI that matches and have
all these things that come after it so

72
00:05:18.322 --> 00:05:23.100
instead of,
it's basically using SAS selectors without

73
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.072
producing all that extra craft
because how it just basically

74
00:05:28.072 --> 00:05:32.300
it puts it all in one line and
it doesn't expand it.

75
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.450
It's nicely there, see an LI that matches.

76
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.191
It has a title, it has a role,
either one, and then an A.

77
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:45.627
So any A that is the descendant of
an ally that has a title or a roll.

78
00:05:45.627 --> 00:05:47.570
It basically matches this.

79
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.715
So, this right here is
a very simple example, so

80
00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:55.152
the second one is actually
shorter than the first one.

81
00:05:55.152 --> 00:06:00.446
But can you imagine if you
had long class names and

82
00:06:00.446 --> 00:06:04.593
16 of them or added here we have any,

83
00:06:09.513 --> 00:06:11.130
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Where was I?

84
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.740
Here, so let's just put a return in here.

85
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.890
So I can see it.

86
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.750
So any a that is either focused or
active, right?

87
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.159
That is nested within a slide that
matches, that is either a descendant of

88
00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:31.083
home, an element with an ID of home, or
an element with the ID of contact, right?

89
00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:33.406
So it's one line that matches these four

90
00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:39.124
lines.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let

91
00:06:39.124 --> 00:06:41.760
me just get rid of all of this and
see if there's anything else.

92
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.573
It is supported in Safari right now.

93
00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.624
So you can actually play with it live and

94
00:06:49.624 --> 00:06:53.241
you can do it if you're
targeting only on iOS.

95
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:59.170
So similar to matches, we actually
have something that does match.

96
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.490
So this is something you can use.

97
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.024
What I just explained and said you can't
use, you actually can use with prefix,

98
00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:05.563
and I do.

99
00:07:05.563 --> 00:07:10.921
This is one of those things where in
terms of JavaScript when I want to

100
00:07:10.921 --> 00:07:16.710
reach a bunch of elements,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I can do it this way.

101
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.388
So I can use query selector all and
match and put this in matches.

102
00:07:21.388 --> 00:07:26.675
So in Safari, it's matches.

103
00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:31.925
In Chrome and Android,
it's -webkit-any, and

104
00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:36.919
in Firefox, it's -moz-any.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

105
00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:41.819
what does this is not match?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Edge, right?

106
00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:45.086
We're not targeting, but
if you're gonna do mobile,

107
00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:49.863
who here has a Windows phone?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So sad,

108
00:07:49.863 --> 00:07:51.400
I feel so bad for them.

109
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.908
No, I don't.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you can actually use

110
00:07:55.908 --> 00:08:01.380
matches but it's pretty fixed with any for
web kit and missile.

111
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.563
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This

112
00:08:07.563 --> 00:08:12.132
is basically showing if you just
used this which is pretty simple,

113
00:08:12.132 --> 00:08:15.980
it expands out to that,
which is not so simple, right?

114
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.600
So it's a span,
that is descendant of bam, bar, or

115
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.180
foo of a link that has
either of those classes.

116
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.220
And so you would actually have to,
and you can put the not.

117
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.730
So you can say any link other than
one that has the class of bam,

118
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.740
bar or foo, so match all
the links in this entire document,

119
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.856
except ones that have these three classes.

120
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:47.030
So you can put a matches inside a not and
do really complex things.

121
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.902
So the weird things is, let's say

122
00:08:51.902 --> 00:08:56.890
we had foo, bar and bam, right?

123
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.280
What is the specificity of this?

124
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.050
It depends what is matching.

125
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:09.550
So if it matched, it's basically
the highest cuz in here would be not.

126
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:15.267
So the specificity would be one ID.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: One element and

127
00:09:15.267 --> 00:09:15.980
one element.

128
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.130
So when you have three things in here,
I believe and I'm not 100% sure so

129
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.590
I would have to double check.

130
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.716
But I believe it is the one with the
strongest weight when it's not matching

131
00:09:27.716 --> 00:09:32.257
and when it is matching it is whatever the
weight of the property that is matching.

132
00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:37.543
So here, if it was bam it
would be matching at 0 1 1.

133
00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:40.671
And if it was foo it would
be matching at 1 0 1.

134
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:47.418
Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

135
00:09:47.418 --> 00:09:50.860
we were going to have the reference
combinator and it was removed.

136
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.651
So I don't know if it was supported
anywhere, but that was basically if you

137
00:09:55.651 --> 00:10:00.593
could actually say find an element that
is referenced by this other element,

138
00:10:00.593 --> 00:10:03.803
which would be really good for
inputs and labels.

139
00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:06.717
And would be really good for ARIA,

140
00:10:06.717 --> 00:10:12.257
because a lot of times in ARIA you
say labeled by this other thing.

141
00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:14.120
And would be good for data lists.

142
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.422
Do you all know what a data list is?

143
00:10:16.422 --> 00:10:19.210
Okay, so an input.

144
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.567
Have you ever seen a select and
it looks like an input and

145
00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:29.087
you have all these options and
Google Chrome it's what do I want for?

146
00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.904
And you'd think it'd say Christmas but

147
00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:34.230
it really is going to be some
inappropriate thing that you can't repeat.

148
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.567
Because people search for
really weird things online.

149
00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:41.190
And most people just fake it
when you have those pictures.

150
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.511
Have you ever gone to Twitter and
you've seen?

151
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.286
That's because that's
what they search for.

152
00:10:46.286 --> 00:10:48.049
Because I don't get the same
results that they do.

153
00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:49.260
Yeah.

154
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.360
They're just basically telling
you what they're searching for.

155
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.170
So anyway, that's a drop down.

156
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.350
It's kind of like it's an input, but
there's a drop down with options.

157
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.440
There's a native element
in HTML that does that.

158
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.810
It is the list attribute on the input,
so you put list and

159
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:11.090
then you point it to
the ID of the data list,

160
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.460
and the data list is basically
a series of options, but

161
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.050
it's not in a select,
instead it's in a data list element.

162
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:25.340
And you basically give it all sorts
of options, and then when you are on.

163
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.030
I'll show you that during the break.

164
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.460
It's really cool and you can basically
do that natively in the browser without

165
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.010
adding any JavaScript frameworks.

166
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:41.096
So anyways, we don't get that, instead,
we go on to the parent selector,

167
00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:45.631
so originally it was going to be this,
and now it is going to be this.

168
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:51.392
Not supported yet, so that could change,
but like a header that has an h1,

169
00:11:51.392 --> 00:11:56.448
h2, basically a header that has
a heading is what this would say.

170
00:11:56.448 --> 00:12:01.280
A header that does not have a heading,
header not has.

171
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.910
So, the reason that we haven't been
able to get a parent selector is because

172
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.800
when I said earlier that things needed to
be prefixed until they were ready to ship,

173
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.420
performance of checking every element
to see what descendants they have

174
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.790
is very slow.

175
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.330
So, they've never figured out
a performant enough way to do this.

176
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.410
And there is something down there.

177
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.050
And I can't show it to you or I could,
let me just show it to you here,

178
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.210
Inspect, and then go to slide.

179
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.014
And then increase the slide size.

180
00:12:39.014 --> 00:12:42.448
So this is an inspector, I told you
I would show you the inspector and

181
00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:45.740
what I want to do is I want to
increase the size of my slides.

182
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:52.413
So I can actually live change my slides
and I just give it a height of 800 and

183
00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:56.480
then I lost everything
because this is live and

184
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.970
that's how my luck works.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There we are.

185
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:09.420
Okay, so header contains
something that is not a header.

186
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:17.900
So this one says a header that has
something, right, it has a child

187
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:23.020
that is not an h1, h2, h3, so you can
get really complex with these things.

188
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:29.460
So when you say you can't target something
with an ID or a class, yeah, you can.

189
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.316
I wouldn't do this in production,
this is just too complex, but you can.

190
00:13:33.316 --> 00:13:34.647
You can actually do that.

191
00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:43.051
And so let's see if the parent selector
is supported yet, open in the new window.

192
00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:46.310
And no,
parent selectors are not selected yet.

193
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.543
So okay, so we still have to wait a while.
