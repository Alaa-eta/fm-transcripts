00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:04.968
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
the next section is pseudo elements, and

2
00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:09.670
you can find it on the Github page in
slide 79, which is where we're starting.

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.170
So there are several pseudo elements, and
since CSS 2.1, they've had two colons in

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.160
front of them to differentiate between
pseudo elements and pseudo classes.

5
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.540
If you actually put one colon, they work
fine, but the correct syntax is two.

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.980
So we have first-line, first-letter,
selection, before, and after.

7
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.410
And interestingly,
selection is not in the specification,

8
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.295
not even yet in CSS level four.

9
00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:43.180
Pseudo-classes select
elements that actually exist.

10
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.455
There is something before the element,
you know there is an opening and

11
00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:49.031
closing tag or a faux tag.

12
00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:53.300
Pseudo-elements create these faux or fake,
if you've ever heard of faux pearls that

13
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.169
means they're not really pearls, but
it sounds French, so it sounds fancy.

14
00:00:57.169 --> 00:01:01.624
So it's like a faux element that
creates a fake before and after and

15
00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:04.899
then whatever content is
in there you can style.

16
00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.276
So in this section the first letter,
pseudo-element,

17
00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:12.557
it's as if there was
a first element tag and

18
00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:17.700
end first element tag,
right around that first letter.

19
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.080
So in this case I have targeted,
with the selector,

20
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.440
the first letter of the paragraph
that is the first of its type.

21
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.368
And the reason I have to chosen paragraph
first of its type is because if I didn't,

22
00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:34.220
the drop caps would look
absolutely horrendous and

23
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.110
it would be impossible to read.

24
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.230
So this is an example of combining
a pseudo element with a pseudo class,

25
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.130
or structural selector to just hit
one thing that you really wanna hit.

26
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.710
So you can always use
combinations like this.

27
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.810
So in this case it's as if that letter
y itself was in its own element.

28
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.711
And we were able to style it,
but because it is a letter,

29
00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:06.865
you kind of have position it to give it.

30
00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:10.746
It's like an inline span,
you can't do everything to it.

31
00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:14.090
But in this case, by positioning it,

32
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.693
we've given it three times the size and
floated it.

33
00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:27.730
And the reason that we floated it because
if we didn't float it, it looks better.

34
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.554
It floats it and
you put the text around it.

35
00:02:29.554 --> 00:02:31.980
So that's first-letter,

36
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.870
it's just a way to style the first letter
which is usually used for drop caps.

37
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.190
Next we have selection and
here I am selecting this and it is red.

38
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.291
Everywhere else that I selected something,
it wasn't red, it was blue,

39
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:48.604
which was the default.

40
00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:53.453
But here I changed the selection,
and here it says, in this slide,

41
00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:58.490
anything that I select, make
the background red and the color white.

42
00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:05.890
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Thought there
would be more outside this,

43
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.377
I'm gonna cover it a little
bit more again later.
