00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.920
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
the next section is Pseudo-elements.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.219
And you can find it on the GitHub page,
and

3
00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:09.670
slide 79 which is where we're starting.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.135
So there are several Pseudo-elements and
since CSS 2.1, they've had two colons in

5
00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:21.160
front of them to differentiate between
Pseudo-elements and Pseudo-classes.

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.540
If you actually put one colon, they work
fine, but the correct syntax is two.

7
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.980
So we have first-line, first-letter,
selection, before, and after.

8
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.140
And interestingly, selection is not
in the specification, not even yet

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.295
in CSS sockages level four.

10
00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:43.180
Pseudo-classes select
elements that actually exist.

11
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.070
There is something before the element.

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.320
There's an opening and
closing tag or a full tag.

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.191
Pseudo elements create these faux or
fake, if you've ever heard of faux pearls,

14
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:57.390
that means they're not really pearls,
but it sounds French so it sounds fancy.

15
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.270
So it's like a faux element
that creates a fake before and

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.140
after and then whatever content
is in there you can style.

17
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.850
So in this section the first-letter
pseudo element it's as if there was

18
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.690
a first element tag and
a first element tag

19
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.080
right around that first letter so in this
case I have targeted with the selector

20
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.440
the first letter of the paragraph
that is the first of its type.

21
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.310
And the reason I have chosen to do first
of its paragraph first of its type

22
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.220
is because if I didn't the drop caps
would look absolutely horrendous and

23
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.110
it would be impossible to read.

24
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.413
So this is an example of
combining pseudo element with

25
00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:45.090
a pseudo class,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or a structural selector.

26
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.130
To just hit one thing that
you really want to hit.

27
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.710
So you can always use
combinations like this.

28
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.810
So in this case it's as if that letter
Y itself was in its own element.

29
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.350
And we were able to style it.

30
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.070
But because it is a letter you kind
of have to position it to give it.

31
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.970
You can't.

32
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.650
It's like an in line spin,
you can't do everything to it.

33
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.120
But in this case, by positioning it,

34
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.670
we've given it three times the size and
floated it.

35
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.428
And the reason that we floated it
because if we didn't float it,

36
00:02:21.428 --> 00:02:27.730
it looks better.

37
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.530
It floats it, and
you put the text around it.

38
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.980
So that's first-letter.

39
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.870
It's just a way to style the first letter,
which is usually used for drop caps.

40
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.190
Next we have selection, and
here I am selecting this, and it is red.

41
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.280
Everywhere else that I selected something,
it wasn't red.

42
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.780
It was blue.

43
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.190
Which was the default, but
here I changed the selection.

44
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.824
And here it says, in this slide, anything
that I select, make the background red and

45
00:02:56.824 --> 00:03:03.552
the color white.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Thought

46
00:03:03.552 --> 00:03:06.081
there would be more balloons outside this.

47
00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:07.701
I'm gonna cover it a little
bit more again later.
