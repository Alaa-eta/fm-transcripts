00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's move a long and
talk about alignment.

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.850
This is gonna be very similar to what we
talked about with flex blocks yesterday.

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.090
We have several properties
that are on the parent,

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.285
including justify-items,
align-items, justify-content,

5
00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:21.130
align-content, grid auto columns,
grid auto rows, grid auto flow, and grid.

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.002
And then we have justify-self and
align-self,

7
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:31.109
which are properties on
the grid items themselves.

8
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.110
So justify-items has a few new
values that we never heard of.

9
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.843
One of them is legacy and
then two are safe and unsafe.

10
00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:46.037
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
I'll go over those in a minute.

11
00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:48.183
The default is actually legacy.

12
00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:49.277
Is left.

13
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.341
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Just a found,
that's what it comes out to.

14
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:59.504
So the only thing that's actually what it
means but that's what it ends up being.

15
00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:02.782
I guess it would be right and
left to right languages.

16
00:01:02.782 --> 00:01:05.980
So justify-items.

17
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.299
It aligns items in the in-line direction,
which for us is horizontal.

18
00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.279
Let's just go and do it by example.

19
00:01:24.603 --> 00:01:29.248
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So when we were
doing flex box, we sometimes aligned

20
00:01:29.248 --> 00:01:34.220
the whole row, and
we sometimes aligned just the item.

21
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.491
So when it says justify-items,
it's actually taking that grid item and

22
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:45.264
aligning just each item individually.

23
00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:47.310
But it's doing it globally for
all them but

24
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.780
it's individual within each item,
putting it at the end.

25
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.540
Here, we can put it at the start.

26
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.720
What are the other values we have?

27
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.710
We have stretch, and we have have center,
and we have self-end.

28
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.753
So, let's do center.

29
00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:09.081
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now the thing is,
this stuff is really ugly and

30
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:13.426
I've never used this property in
because I've never needed to do this,

31
00:02:13.426 --> 00:02:16.280
cuz I don't find it attractive.

32
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.602
But it is important to
understand that it's doable.

33
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.153
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the new values
are safe, which means if it overflows

34
00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:34.477
the container,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If

35
00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:38.810
the text overlines the container,
then you actually still show the content.

36
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.500
And unsafe, it basically says,
you're gonna crop it.

37
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.470
So legacy is basically, you could
say legacy, left, center, or right.

38
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.300
And that's about it, okay.

39
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.050
So then we have column alignment
which we do with align-items.

40
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.259
So we did justify-items, right,

41
00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:02.099
which was kinda left to right
in left-to-right languages.

42
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.620
Here, if we do flex start, which

43
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.350
you'll notice is a flex property, it's
the same thing as it was in flex, right?

44
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.650
We could do flex-end.

45
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.260
So it's aligning each item
within its grid line,

46
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.310
right, along the road track.

47
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.277
The previous one did
along the column track.

48
00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:38.000
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Stretch is nice.

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.012
I think that's the default.

50
00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:45.052
I forgot to highlight which one is
the default but I'm pretty sure it's that.

51
00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:52.027
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's
a property called place-items,

52
00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:56.638
which is basically align-items,
and then justify-items.

53
00:03:56.638 --> 00:03:59.027
And this is short hand.

54
00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:00.324
Also the order does matter.

55
00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:05.610
You have to put align-items first and
then justify-items.

56
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.647
If you only put one property there,
if you just include the align-items,

57
00:04:09.647 --> 00:04:12.480
that value will be given
to justify-items as well.

58
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.320
So let's play with making this
hideous just for a minute.

59
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.853
So we have align-items,

60
00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:30.509
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Which is aligning items

61
00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.658
within its column, right?

62
00:04:34.658 --> 00:04:36.360
That's what justify-items does.

63
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.062
Left, or right, or center.

64
00:04:41.672 --> 00:04:42.390
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Horizontally.

65
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.664
And then align-items is vertical.

66
00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:53.166
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here we put it at
the top, here we put it at the end,

67
00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:54.910
here we stretched it.

68
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.640
But notice, even though it's stretched in
the height, it's still at the flex-end.

69
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.560
And we can center,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: and center.

70
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.080
Now, you might wanna
actually create this effect.

71
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.270
I don't think you do.

72
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.132
I don't use these, but it's important
to know that they exist, right.

73
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:25.958
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: When would you use this?

74
00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.673
So remember that example
with the unicorns?

75
00:05:30.673 --> 00:05:34.138
And there was a unicorn and
then a paragraph and there was space and

76
00:05:34.138 --> 00:05:36.157
then there was a button at the bottom?

77
00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:40.594
You would just put
the button at the flex-end.

78
00:05:40.594 --> 00:05:43.527
But the way we did it
before is we actually

79
00:05:43.527 --> 00:05:47.148
put,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: when we did with the flex

80
00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:52.810
items, we put the image and
then we put the button in the third item.

81
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.549
And then we'd allow
the middle one to grow, and

82
00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:59.125
we didn't allow the first one or
the third one to grow, okay.

83
00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:02.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question.

84
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.690
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If we're using legacy how do

85
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.960
we declare that it can inherit?

86
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.710
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Just, you don't even
have to use- You can just omit it.

87
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.676
It's legacy.

88
00:06:10.676 --> 00:06:11.247
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.

89
00:06:13.732 --> 00:06:15.667
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Basically, you just
have to overwrite legacy if you want

90
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.282
something else.

91
00:06:16.282 --> 00:06:16.799
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: All right.

92
00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:17.942
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's a default value.
