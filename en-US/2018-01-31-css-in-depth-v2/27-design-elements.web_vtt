00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.080
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we talked
a little bit about design elements,

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.830
let's go back to it.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.790
So here's another thought bubble.

4
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.210
So the first thought bubble
was with a triangle.

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.970
This thought bubble is using
a border radius and positioning so

6
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.490
it's basically putting a 50% border
radius on the thought bubble.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.470
And then it's creating
two circles before and

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.110
after which just basically
has two different sizes.

9
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.860
One has height and
width of 40 the other has height and

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.230
width of 20 so
one's half the size of the other one.

11
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.030
Border radius of 50% and

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.520
I position them absolutely to make
them look like a thought bubble.

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.680
Is this okay to use, yes.

14
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.178
There is no significant information
to the screen reader that

15
00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:45.954
the screen reader would need to know.

16
00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:50.887
And though text is still there,
if this was really

17
00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:55.701
important in a comic,
it would just say the guy or

18
00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:00.410
the character said it,
not that he thought it.

19
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.960
But you could actually add accessibility
features to say that it was

20
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.730
a thought and not.

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.990
Then Chris Quirer put out this neat little
blog and it is the shapes of CSS and

22
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.780
he used generated content to
create all of these shapes.

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.670
These are just one element
with generated content and

24
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010
you can do all sorts of things.

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.521
I'm going through it quickly because it's
just to show you that it is possible how

26
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.260
was ying-yang done, before and
after, that is really impressive.

27
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.690
Isn't that pretty awesome?

28
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.340
Okay and

29
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.470
then some more thoughts of what you could
do the shapes article was included,

30
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.170
the printing of the URLs,
remember that one?

31
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.220
Clearing floats, that we don't
need to do anymore pretty soon,

32
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.250
because I'm gonna show you flex block and
grid.

33
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.827
Samurai I think it was, made all of
these icons out of generated content.

34
00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.220
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Remember
when we were talking about.

35
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.050
Let me see if I can make this bigger.

36
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.510
Okay, so here is an idea of making,
of adding based on attributes,

37
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.950
and the size of the screen,
adding features.

38
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.540
So on a large monitor
when you see an email,

39
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.870
you get the email printed afterwards and
the email icon before.

40
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.930
If it's a medium screen,
it's just the name and

41
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.600
the email address printed afterwards.

42
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.610
if it's a tablet the word email comes
before, if it's smaller still you get

43
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.530
just the icon, and if it's even smaller
you just get the link and that's it.

44
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.780
So it's basically saying what
is the size of my screen?

45
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.901
Depending on the size of your screen,
add these features.

46
00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:56.833
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's see a few more,
ribbons.

47
00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:01.160
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah, here's a ribbon.

48
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.540
Okay, and here's the badass tool tip,

49
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.630
which is kind of what we did
earlier with the Google thing.

50
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.400
Okay, so we're not going to do this.

51
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.450
This is an example.

52
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.580
But this is a very clear case of why

53
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.250
you wouldn't not want to
make this position relative.

54
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.730
Because if this was position relative this
word tool tip all the time- then when I

55
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.640
went over generated content the word
tool tip would come right through.

56
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.920
Thank you.

57
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.050
So, we're going to take a five minute
break now before we hit media queries.

58
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.935
So if you want to you can
actually go hit this and

59
00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:53.328
try figuring out how to do this.
