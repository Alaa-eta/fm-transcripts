00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.080
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we talked
a little bit about design elements.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.830
Let's go back to it.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.790
So here's another thought bubble.

4
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.210
So the first thought bubble
was with the triangle.

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.970
This thought bubble is using
border radius and positioning, so

6
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.490
it's basically putting a 50% border
radius on the thought bubble.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.402
And then it's creating two circles,
a before and after,

8
00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:25.850
which just basically
have two different sizes.

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.381
One has height and width of 40, the other
one has a height and width of 20, so

10
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:32.249
one's half the size of the other one,
border radius of 50%.

11
00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:35.952
And then I position them absolutely to
make it look like a thought bubble.

12
00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:37.832
Is this okay to use?

13
00:00:37.832 --> 00:00:42.798
Yes, there's no significant
information to the screen reader that

14
00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:45.543
the screen reader would need to know.

15
00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:50.425
And though text is still there,
if this was really

16
00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:56.120
important like in a comic,
it would just say that the guy or

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.439
character said it, not that he thought it.

18
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.960
But you could actually add accessibility
features to say that it was

19
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.704
a thought and not.

20
00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:11.930
Then Chris put out this neat little
blog and it is The Shapes of CSS,

21
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.780
and he's generated content to
create all of these shapes.

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.670
These are just one element
with generated content and

23
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010
you can do all sorts of things.

24
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.170
I'm going through it quickly because it's
just to show you that it's possible.

25
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.110
How was ying yang done before and after?

26
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.260
That is really impressive.

27
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.531
Isn't that pretty awesome?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

28
00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:39.963
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then some

29
00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:45.470
more thoughts of what you could do,
the shapes article was included.

30
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.540
The printing of the URLs.

31
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.308
Remember that one?

32
00:01:50.308 --> 00:01:54.637
Clearing floats, that we don't need to do
anymore pretty soon because I'm gonna show

33
00:01:54.637 --> 00:02:01.185
you flexbox and grid.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I think it was, made all

34
00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:06.603
of these icons out of generated content.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Remember

35
00:02:06.603 --> 00:02:08.043
when we were talking about,

36
00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:13.391
let me see if I can make this bigger.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

37
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:18.036
so here is an idea of adding
based on attributes and

38
00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:21.807
the size of the screen adding features.

39
00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.718
So on a large monitor,
when you see an email,

40
00:02:24.718 --> 00:02:28.870
you get the email printed afterwards and
the email icon before.

41
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.930
If it's a medium screen,
it's just the name and

42
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.600
the email address printed afterwards.

43
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.400
If it's a tablet,
the word email comes before.

44
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.530
If it's smaller still,
you get just the icon.

45
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.295
And if it's even smaller,
you just get the link and that's it.

46
00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:48.646
So it's basically saying what is the size
of my screen depending on the size of your

47
00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:55.696
screen, add these features.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's see a few more.

48
00:02:55.696 --> 00:03:02.221
Ribbons.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah, here's a ribbon.

49
00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:07.177
Okay, and here's the badass tooltip which
is kind of what we did earlier with

50
00:03:07.177 --> 00:03:12.207
the Google thing.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

51
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.135
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we're not gonna do

52
00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:18.168
this, this is an example but

53
00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:24.015
this is a very clear case of why you would
not wanna make this as position relative,

54
00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:29.220
because if this was position relative,
this were tooltip all the time.

55
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.646
Then when I went over generated content,
the word tooltip would come right through.

56
00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:37.099
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

57
00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.539
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Thank you.

58
00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:44.483
So we're going to take a five minute
break now before we hit media queries.

59
00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:49.731
So if you want to,
you can actually go hit this and

60
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:53.190
try figuring out how to do this.
