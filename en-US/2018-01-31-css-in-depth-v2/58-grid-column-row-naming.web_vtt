00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:06.306
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There I showed you how to
have the four values of grid-row-start,

2
00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.850
grid-column-start, grid-row-end,
and grid-column-end.

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.450
Let's say you only have
three values there.

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.093
If you omit grid-column-end, then
the grid-column-end value will either be,

5
00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:25.305
if you named the grid-column-start,
that's what it'll be or elso

6
00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:31.340
it would be auto which I think is just 1,
not 100% sure, it will be one over.

7
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.058
So let's try that.

8
00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:40.615
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's just 1 wide.

9
00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:45.753
If however, I did

10
00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:53.960
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Start, right?

11
00:00:58.415 --> 00:00:59.791
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Repeat 3.

12
00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:13.140
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Mid
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Repeat

13
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.640
9.

14
00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:22.437
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: End.

15
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.769
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
let me just put this in here.

16
00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:35.285
Okay, so,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here,

17
00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:39.650
I actually now have named grid lines.

18
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.239
So it's start or 1, I can use either one.

19
00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.856
So I could do 1 here, right?

20
00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:48.585
Or I could say start.

21
00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:59.684
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 1, 2,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Start,

22
00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:01.282
that's what I meant to do.

23
00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:05.213
So here I do start, or I do 1.

24
00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:06.507
Same thing, right?

25
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.237
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Start or 1.

26
00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:18.612
Because the first line is called start but
it's still always gonna be 1.

27
00:02:18.612 --> 00:02:23.680
And the wierd thing is you can actually
name many of them, use the same name.

28
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.140
You can use the name over and over again.

29
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.690
So I can do start, start, start, start.

30
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.500
So if I was having a 12-column layout, I
could have every third one named start and

31
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.730
that way it would be whichever
closest one is that start.

32
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.424
So let's go with start here.

33
00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:47.870
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Go with mid here.

34
00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:54.347
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And 1fr,

35
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.370
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's a typo here.

36
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there
a space between 1 and fr?

37
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.385
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Thank you,
perfect, thank you.

38
00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:16.391
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So this goes back to what
I had originally, which was 2, right?

39
00:03:18.842 --> 00:03:19.989
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So it went to 2 and 5.

40
00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.974
And I need to make this 8,
so it's the same as before.

41
00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:26.286
Okay, so that's the same as before, right?

42
00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:34.964
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We named the columns but
we didn't name the rows,

43
00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:41.109
cuz we didn't actually do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's

44
00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.555
just do the exact same thing with rows.

45
00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.784
Okay?

46
00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:49.477
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
now we can use start start,

47
00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:54.734
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And mid mid.

48
00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.566
So you see, I actually reused the names,
grid and column,

49
00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:59.106
definitely no conflict there.

50
00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:08.916
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So if I get rid of d,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It set it to auto.

51
00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:20.014
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I have
no clue why it did that.

52
00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:28.928
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Cuz if it's a / b,
it should be grid-row-end and

53
00:04:28.928 --> 00:04:31.300
grid-column-end are omitted.

54
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.842
And if c,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If

55
00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:42.539
grid-row-start was named, it should
have been named the start but it wasn't.

56
00:04:45.727 --> 00:04:48.006
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Cuz I named both of them,
so I don't know why it did that.

57
00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:49.226
Okay.

58
00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:52.925
We're not gonna go deeper
into that cuz no point to it.

59
00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:57.040
But basically we realize that
you can do four values and

60
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.356
if you don't do four values,
it defaults to one or auto.

61
00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:03.200
[LAUGH] Yes?

62
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Even though
the syntax call start and end.

63
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.720
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It seems like

64
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.620
you can reverse them.

65
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.458
They're really just boundaries.

66
00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:12.516
So you can do 2, 5, 5, 2 and
it seems to do the same?

67
00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:14.124
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yes, so
let's just show you that.

68
00:05:14.124 --> 00:05:19.899
So grid-column, 2, 5,
5, 2, very good point.

69
00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:22.564
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That would
be in the deeper dive.

70
00:05:22.564 --> 00:05:24.747
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Does RTL kind of thing,

71
00:05:24.747 --> 00:05:28.822
what are the impacts of shifting your-
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

72
00:05:28.822 --> 00:05:30.170
it's kinda like flexbox.

73
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.060
If you remember yesterday
when I discussed flexbox and

74
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.280
basically said main direction is this
way but in right to left languages,

75
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.941
it will actually reverse it for you.

76
00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:39.441
Yeah.
