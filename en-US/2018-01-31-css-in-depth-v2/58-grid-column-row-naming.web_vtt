00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:06.322
&gt;&gt; Estelle: There I showed you how to
have the four values of grid-row-start,

2
00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:09.850
grid-column-start, grid-row-end,
and grid-column-end.

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.562
Let's say you only have
three values there.

4
00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:19.102
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If you omit grid-column-end,
then the grid column end value will

5
00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:24.622
either be, if you name the grid
column start, that's what will it be,

6
00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:28.578
or else it would be auto,
which I think is just one,

7
00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:33.283
not 100% sure, it will be one over,
so let's try that.

8
00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:42.778
&gt;&gt; Estelle: It's just one wide.

9
00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:45.852
If, however, I did,

10
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.033
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Start, right?

11
00:00:58.287 --> 00:00:59.672
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Repeat three.

12
00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:04.274
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Mid

13
00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:13.724
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Repeat nine.

14
00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:22.472
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And
&gt;&gt; Estelle: End.

15
00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:31.564
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so
let me just put this in here, okay so.

16
00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:39.650
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Here,
I actually have now named grid lines.

17
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.550
So it's start or one.

18
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.370
I can use either one.

19
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.090
So I could do one here, right?

20
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.923
Or I could say start.

21
00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.296
&gt;&gt; Estelle: One, two.

22
00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:00.990
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Start.

23
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.950
That's what I meant to do.

24
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.707
So here I do start or
I do one, same thing, right?

25
00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:15.659
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Start or one because
the first line is called start but

26
00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.899
still always gonna be one.

27
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.680
And the weird thing is you can actually
name many of them use the same name.

28
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.690
You can use the name over and over again,
so I could do start, start, start, start.

29
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.700
So if I was having like a 12 column
layout, I could have every third one

30
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.570
named start, and that way would be
whichever closest one is at start.

31
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.402
So let's go with start here and

32
00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:51.131
then go with mid here.

33
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:53.756
And one fr.

34
00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.370
&gt;&gt; Estelle: There is a typo here.

35
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there
a space between 1 and F4?

36
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.853
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Thank you perfect, thank you.

37
00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.840
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So this goes back to where
I had originally which was to right.

38
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.877
So one to two and five.

39
00:03:20.877 --> 00:03:24.483
And I need to make this eight so
it's the same as before.

40
00:03:24.483 --> 00:03:27.075
Okay so that's the same as before right.

41
00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:32.228
So let's we named the console but

42
00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:37.198
we didn't name the rose because

43
00:03:37.198 --> 00:03:41.070
we didn't actually do.

44
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.004
Let's just do the exact
same thing with rose

45
00:03:44.004 --> 00:03:48.453
okay,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

46
00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:55.090
now we can use start / start and
mid / mid.

47
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.950
So you see how we actually
reuse the names, grid-column,

48
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.920
definitely no conflict there.

49
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.813
So If I get rid of d.

50
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.260
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Let's say it's auto.

51
00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.295
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I've no clue why I did that.

52
00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:26.969
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Cuz if it's A, B,

53
00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:31.891
It should be grid-row-end and
grid-column-end are omitted

54
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:38.996
and
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If

55
00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:43.010
grid-row started with a name it should
have been named the start but it wasn't.

56
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.500
Cuz I named both of them so
I don't know why I did that.

57
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.910
Okay, we're not gonna go deeper
into that cuz no point to it.

58
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.820
But basically realize that
you can do four values.

59
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.356
And if you don't do four values,
it defaults to one or auto.

60
00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:03.200
[LAUGH] Yes?

61
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Even though
the syntax false start and end,

62
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.620
it seems like you can reverse them.

63
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.849
They're really just boundaries.

64
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.330
So you can do two five or five two and
it seems to render the same?

65
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.830
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So let's just show you that.

66
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.190
So grid column.

67
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.610
Two five, five two.

68
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.160
Very good point.

69
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.480
That would be in the deeper dive.

70
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does RTL kind of thing?

71
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.610
I mean what are the impacts
of shifting the arguments-

72
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.534
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so it's kind of

73
00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:30.170
like flex box.

74
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.060
If you remember yesterday
when I discussed flex box and

75
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.280
basically said the main direction is
this way but in right to left languages.

76
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.490
It will actually reverse it for you.
