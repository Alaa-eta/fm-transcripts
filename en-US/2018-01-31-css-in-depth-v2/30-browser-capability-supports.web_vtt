WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.116
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Then we have @supports.

2
00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:15.859
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay so whenever I
have a code pend it kind of messes with

3
00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.267
everything, so
I'm just gonna stay on this side and

4
00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.030
then I'll move over to the next side.

5
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.600
So @supports; it basically says,
does this browser support display flex?

6
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.500
If yes, then we can use these features.

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.260
And so a while ago I was actually
talking about the @supports and

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.010
how you could basically say,
does it support ligature?

9
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.420
And if it supports ligature
then use this font, right,

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.680
don't use material icons
unless it supports ligature.

11
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.520
Before we use to have this,
which was media screen and

12
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910
transform 3D or and animation.

13
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.240
That is the old way of doing it so don't
use that anymore, you might see it, so

14
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.850
I'm putting it up just
in case you come across.

15
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.880
It used to be valid and
it still is, it still works but

16
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.220
it only works for transform-3d and
animation, so what's the point?

17
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.580
Whereas this works for,
basically, you put a property and

18
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.470
a value and it's not gonna render
that it just says, can I support it?

19
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.710
So if you've heard of Modernizer,
who here has heard of Modernizer?

20
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.790
Pretty much everyone.

21
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.620
It's basically a Modernizer in
the browser without pulling in

22
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.540
any JavaScript framework.

23
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.621
So a lot of people used to do JS and then
they used to basically decide which CSS

24
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:41.306
features to use based on what
modernizer said was supported.

25
00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:45.401
You don't need to use
modernizer at all for

26
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:50.193
your CSS, you just say hey,
do you support this?

27
00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:51.742
Media screen.

28
00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:58.054
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
there's also the viewport and

29
00:01:58.054 --> 00:02:02.274
I don't know why it's
under the supports but

30
00:02:02.274 --> 00:02:08.161
here it's basically saying,
Microsoft also has a viewport,

31
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:12.847
I don't know why I put that
on in there I'm sorry.

32
00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:17.217
Okay, so here we can just play,
open this one up in a new window and

33
00:02:17.217 --> 00:02:20.088
here it says, media and transform-3d.

34
00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:27.606
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's not supporting
this browser any more, I guess, or

35
00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:30.682
maybe it is and I just spelled it wrong.

36
00:02:33.568 --> 00:02:34.478
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It used to work,

37
00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:37.797
it no longer works,
I'm not sure if it's still supported.

38
00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:40.583
Okay, so here.

39
00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:48.561
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We do the little prayer
of, please, when I reload this page,

40
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:49.157
please work.

41
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.962
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yes,
okay, so here it says,

42
00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:01.535
media screen and web can transition, so

43
00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:06.657
that was probably one
of the words they used.

44
00:03:06.657 --> 00:03:10.888
We have to open up this in a window,
right,

45
00:03:10.888 --> 00:03:15.722
Visit Site, here we go,
I think it won't load.

46
00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:18.649
Okay, this browser supports media and
support.

47
00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:23.221
So what I did here, is I said,
this browser supports media or

48
00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:26.750
supports, and which ones does it support?

49
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.481
And then I did a class of transition,
a class of animation,

50
00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:32.010
a class of transforms and
a class of supports, right?

51
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.316
And then here I did web kit screen and
web kit transition.

52
00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:44.700
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Say transitions, yes,
and it doesn't support that one anymore.

53
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.720
So it used to, but it doesn't anymore and
then, moz transition,

54
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.390
obviously this is not a Mozilla browser,
it's not gonna support that one.

55
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.120
MS transition, it's not gonna
support that one, -o- transition,

56
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.059
not that one, then it says,
does it support transition?

57
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.240
Well that is an old way of writing in it,
it doesn't support that anymore but

58
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.023
all the way down here are the ones where
it does support it which is @supports

59
00:04:09.023 --> 00:04:15.020
(display: table-cell), which is what
we really want to happen, right?

60
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.455
So I'm in Chrome right now and
let's name it advanced feature.

61
00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:21.950
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Anyone?

62
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Grid?

63
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.995
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So display grid.

64
00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:31.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You saw
that bottom one disappear?

65
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.050
If I type in grid, it popped up, okay,

66
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.958
so we know it supports the property value
and it happens to support grid as well.

67
00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:42.596
So.

68
00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:52.516
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can put any
property and value prefixed or not and

69
00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:55.522
it's a way to basically
do browser detection,

70
00:04:55.522 --> 00:05:00.130
cuz I could just basically do browser
detection by doing moz animation.

71
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.250
It doesn't support moz animation.

72
00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:08.082
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And just give it a name,

73
00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:14.389
moz-animation-name and then colon read.

74
00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.532
Does it support that?

75
00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:19.715
Then I know it's a Mozilla browser,
just because I prefixed it with moz.

76
00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:27.187
So that's that's a hack but
it is a way of doing user agent detection.
