WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:05.606
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then we have @supports.

2
00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.205
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so whenever
I've code pinned it kinda messes with

3
00:00:16.205 --> 00:00:16.954
everything.

4
00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:21.014
So I'm just gonna stay on this slide and
then I'll go over the other slide.

5
00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:27.320
So @dupports, it basically says does
this browser support display flex?

6
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.190
If yes, then we can use these features.

7
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.296
And so a while ago I was actually
talking about the @supports,

8
00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:41.017
and how you could basically
say does it support ligature,

9
00:00:41.017 --> 00:00:45.563
and if it supports ligature
then use this font, right.

10
00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:49.585
Don't use material icons
unless it supports ligature.

11
00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:56.528
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Before we used to
have this which was media screen and

12
00:00:56.528 --> 00:01:01.158
(transform-3d) or and animation,
that is the old way of doing it, so

13
00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:02.816
don't use that anymore.

14
00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:05.930
You might see it, so I'm bringing
it up in case you come across it.

15
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.302
It used to be valid.

16
00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:08.498
And it still is and still works.

17
00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:12.754
But it only works for
transform-3d and animation.

18
00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:13.890
So what's the point?

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.708
Whereas this works for
basically you put a property and a value.

20
00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:23.192
And it's not gonna render that,
it just says, can I support it?

21
00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:26.519
So if you've heard of Modernizer,
who here has heard of Modernizer?

22
00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.455
Pretty much everyone.

23
00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:31.350
It's basically Modernizer in
the browser without pulling in any

24
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.846
JavaScript framework.

25
00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:37.462
So a lot of people use to do JS and then
they used to basically decide which CSS

26
00:01:37.462 --> 00:01:41.298
features to use based on what
Modernizer said was supported.

27
00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:44.385
You don't used to use
Modernizer at all for your CSS.

28
00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:46.320
You just say, hey, do you support this?

29
00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:52.971
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Media screen.

30
00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:58.588
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
there's also the viewport, and

31
00:01:58.588 --> 00:02:03.089
I don't know why it's under the supports.

32
00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:07.982
But here, it's basically saying,
Microsoft also has a viewport.

33
00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:10.451
I don't know why I put that
point in there, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:14.075
Okay, so here we can just play.

35
00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:16.780
Open this one up in a new window.

36
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.013
And here it says media and transform-3d.

37
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.112
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's not supporting
this browser anymore, I guess.

38
00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:26.712
Or maybe it is and
I just spelled it wrong.

39
00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:34.406
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It used to work.

40
00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:37.598
It no longer works so
I'm not sure if it's still supported.

41
00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:39.306
Okay, so

42
00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:46.010
here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We

43
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.176
do the little prayer of please when
I reload this page, please work.

44
00:02:53.563 --> 00:02:55.632
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yes, okay.

45
00:02:55.632 --> 00:03:00.996
So here, it says media screen and

46
00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:04.450
web can transition.

47
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.677
So that was probably one
of the words that used.

48
00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:11.618
We have to open this up in a window,
right, does it say?

49
00:03:11.618 --> 00:03:12.795
Here we go.

50
00:03:12.795 --> 00:03:15.597
I think it won't load.

51
00:03:15.597 --> 00:03:18.569
Okay, this browser supports media and
supports.

52
00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.087
So what I did here is I said,
this browser supports media or

53
00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:26.513
supports, and which ones does it support?

54
00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:29.852
And then I did a class of transitions,
a class of animations,

55
00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:32.947
a class of transforms, and
a class of supports, right?

56
00:03:32.947 --> 00:03:40.349
And then here, I did web kit screen and
web kit transition.

57
00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.766
Say transitions yes.

58
00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:44.427
And it doesn't support that one anymore.

59
00:03:44.427 --> 00:03:46.609
So it used to, but it doesn't anymore.

60
00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.479
And then -moz-transition.

61
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.414
Obviously this is not a Mozilla browser.

62
00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:52.078
It's not gonna support that one.

63
00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.214
-ms-transition, it's not
gonna support that one.

64
00:03:54.214 --> 00:03:55.910
-o-transition, not that one.

65
00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.129
Then it says does it support transition?

66
00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.515
Well, that is an old way of writing it.

67
00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:02.899
It doesn't support that anymore.

68
00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.863
But all the way down here are the ones
where it does support it,

69
00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:11.981
which is @supports (display: table-cell).

70
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:14.790
Which is what we really want to happen,
right?

71
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.993
So I'm in Chrome right now.

72
00:04:16.993 --> 00:04:19.456
And let's name an advanced feature.

73
00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:22.549
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Anyone?

74
00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:23.721
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Grid.

75
00:04:24.984 --> 00:04:26.139
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So display grid.

76
00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:31.560
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You saw
that button one disappear?

77
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.851
If I type in grid,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It popped up, okay.

78
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:40.240
So we know it supports the property value.

79
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.984
And it happens to support grid as well.

80
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:49.468
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You

81
00:04:49.468 --> 00:04:53.205
can put any property and
value, prefixed or not.

82
00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:55.769
And it's a way to basically
do browser detection.

83
00:04:55.769 --> 00:05:00.643
Cuz I could just basically do browser
detection by doing -moz-animation.

84
00:05:00.643 --> 00:05:02.275
Does it support -moz-animation?

85
00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:09.180
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I just give it a name.

86
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.139
-moz-animation-name: red.

87
00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.456
Right, does it support that?

88
00:05:15.456 --> 00:05:19.477
Then I know I have a Mozilla browser,
just because I prefixed it with moz.

89
00:05:19.477 --> 00:05:21.606
So that's a hack.

90
00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:26.832
But it is a way of doing user detection.
