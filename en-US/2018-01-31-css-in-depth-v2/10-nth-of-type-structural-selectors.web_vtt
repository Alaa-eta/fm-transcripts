00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:05.320
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we've had the,
let me just go back to here,

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.077
we tried the first-child,
the last-child, the first-of-type,

3
00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:13.980
the last-of-type,
only-child and only-of-type.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.045
But you can be more specific,

5
00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:21.950
you can say the third,
you can say every third,

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.861
so 1, 4, 7, 10, or 2, 5, 8, 11.

7
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:30.350
You can say, there's two key terms,
there's odd and even.

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.940
But otherwise, it's an equation that
is an + b, the b being the offset.

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.270
And the offset can be negative.

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.180
And the an,
the n is actually the letter n.

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.390
The a is the variable, and
it's basically what's the incrementer?

12
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.210
Is that right?
Is that the right word?

13
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.370
No, we've been way too long since
seventh grade when I learned algebra.

14
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.680
It is an interval.

15
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.380
It's an interval of three if we put 3n.

16
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.630
It's something like the incrementer,
whatever.

17
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.130
So letter n is the thing that is, it's not
required because if you leave out here,

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.370
we left it out and so
it's just the fifth element, right?

19
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.570
But if you're going to iterate, then it is
the letter n, and there can't be a space,

20
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.670
this is wrong, this will not work,
that works, okay?

21
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.850
So the equation is an plus b,

22
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.110
which b is the first value where you start
counting, so it could be negative 7.

23
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.810
And if the incrementer was 3 so
it's 3n minus 7, well,

24
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.800
there's no negative 4 and there's no
negative 1, so we really start with 2.

25
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.886
But if you had b being 12, so it's 3n
plus 12 it would then be the first item

26
00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:55.922
to be targeted would be number 12, and
it'll be number 15, number 18, number 21.

27
00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:04.246
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We left off the CSS for

28
00:02:04.246 --> 00:02:05.670
this one, most likely.

29
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.253
Okay, so let's,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.

30
00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:19.828
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
before we had flexbox,

31
00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:24.494
let me see if I can,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Make the flexbox,

32
00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:28.760
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Kinda go like that.

33
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.920
Okay, so I'm just gonna go to these
two slides until we can catch up,

34
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.500
because there's a typo
in one of those slides.

35
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.680
Okay, so
here we have structural selectors.

36
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.130
And the first child and
the last child are both bold.

37
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.774
We have ten,
what number is the first and the last?

38
00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:49.119
One and ten.

39
00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.530
So one and ten are both bold.

40
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.707
Then we have the first-of-type and
the last-of-type because the only

41
00:02:57.707 --> 00:03:02.900
thing that can be a descendant of,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Of an ordered or

42
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.660
unordered list is an li.

43
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.810
So it matches the first child and
last child.

44
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.570
But it could have been if we
had done paragraphs and h1s,

45
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.530
it would have been different.

46
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.160
Then we have nth-child even,
background-color grey.

47
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.420
And so you will notice that 2, 4, 6,
8 and 10 have a background color of gray.

48
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.864
And then it says, nth-child 3, so
just the third one, make it gray.

49
00:03:31.202 --> 00:03:36.687
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: As in the color, and
so you'll see all of them are black or

50
00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:40.017
blue except for number 3 is gray.

51
00:03:40.017 --> 00:03:43.433
And then it says,
nth-of-type odd, make it white,

52
00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:47.608
which just make it stripe,
I could've made it a different color.

53
00:03:47.608 --> 00:03:50.560
And then nth-of-type 4n,
so that means every 4th.

54
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.850
So it's number 4, number 8,
if we had continued,

55
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.400
it'd have been number 12, number 16,
number 20, number 24, so that's 4n.

56
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.450
And then the last equation says 3n- 1.

57
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.416
So we start with n being 0 and
3n- 1 is negative, so that doesn't count.

58
00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:17.344
Then we say if n was 1,
it would be 3 times 1 is 3 minus 1 is 2.

59
00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:23.020
And then if n was 2, it would be 2
times 3 which is 6 minus 1 is 5.

60
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.090
Who said you didn't need to know math,
right?

61
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.660
So we have number 2, number 5, number 8.

62
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.000
And it would have also
continued onto number 11.

63
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.640
And we can continue to add in some
item of making those aligned right.

64
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.640
Do people understand
the equation of an plus b?

65
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.140
Okay.

66
00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:49.110
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
before we had flexbox,

67
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.400
you could do stupid petrics like these.

68
00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.260
Which is you could say the element that is
only of its type, give it a width of 100%.

69
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.888
If you have two elements, so the first
element would be the first of its type and

70
00:05:07.888 --> 00:05:13.260
the nth last of its type
starting from the end.

71
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.750
So here I'm showing you last-of-type.

72
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.924
We have not started from the end before.

73
00:05:18.924 --> 00:05:23.309
So nth-last-of-type, so
start at the end and then do the equation.

74
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.250
So an element that is both
the first of its type and

75
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.440
the second from the end,
means there's exactly two elements.

76
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.780
This next line says nth-of-type 2, which
means it's the second element, right?

77
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.980
And it's also the last of its type, right?

78
00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:47.851
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That means it's
exactly 2, but it's the second one.

79
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:52.327
So make those both 50%, and
then going on to the fourth one,

80
00:05:52.327 --> 00:05:56.226
it says nth-of-type 1, nth-last-of-type 4.

81
00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:02.464
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So it's basically saying
something that is the first one and

82
00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:06.137
fourth from the end,
which means it's exactly 4, right?

83
00:06:06.137 --> 00:06:07.971
Make it 25%.

84
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.182
So this is what we could do
before we had flexbox, but

85
00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:12.158
later on today we're
going to cover flexbox.

86
00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:15.107
So we don't need to use
these stupid petrix.

87
00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:23.170
But I just did wanna show you that
you can put two things together,

88
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.454
you can string selectors along like that.

89
00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:31.706
Okay, so I believe we are back to here.

90
00:06:31.706 --> 00:06:38.206
Yes, so here feel free to take
two minutes or three minutes,

91
00:06:38.206 --> 00:06:43.059
let's do three minutes, to play with this.
