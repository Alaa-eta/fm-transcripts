00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:06.321
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let me
just go back to here.

2
00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:09.648
We tried the first-child,
the last-child, the first-of-type,

3
00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:12.482
the last-of-type, only-child,
and only-of-type.

4
00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:13.963
But you can be more specific.

5
00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:17.062
You can say the third.

6
00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:22.177
You can say every third, so 1, 4,

7
00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:27.127
7, 10, or 2, 5, 8, 11.

8
00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:30.365
You can say, there's two key terms,
there's odd, and even.

9
00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:34.730
But otherwise an equation that is an+b.

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.093
The b being the offset, and
the offset can be negative.

11
00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:44.413
And the an,
the n is actually the letter n.

12
00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:50.069
The a is the variable, and
it's basically, what's the incrementer?

13
00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.136
Or is that right, is that the right word?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE].

14
00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:55.523
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No, we've been way

15
00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:59.200
too long since seventh grade
when I learned algebra.

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.947
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

17
00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:03.067
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It is an interval,

18
00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:05.383
it's an interval of 3, if we put 3n.

19
00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:08.780
But it's something like the increment,
whatever.

20
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.360
So the letter n, it's not required.

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.451
Because if you leave out here,
we left it out,

22
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.401
and it says just the fifth element, right?

23
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:22.078
But if you're going to iterate,
then it is the letter n, and

24
00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:25.772
there can't be a space,
this is wrong, this will not work.

25
00:01:25.772 --> 00:01:27.730
That works, okay?

26
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.154
So the equation is an+b, which b is
the first value where you start counting.

27
00:01:34.154 --> 00:01:36.181
So it could be negative 7.

28
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:40.071
And if the incrementer was 3,
so it's 3n minus 7.

29
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:45.120
Well there's no negative 4, and there's no
negative 1, so we'll really start with 2.

30
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.732
But if you had b being 12, so it's 3n +12,

31
00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:53.858
it would then be the first item to
be targeted, would be number 12.

32
00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:55.445
And then it would be number 15, number 18,

33
00:01:55.445 --> 00:02:02.555
number 21.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Hm,

34
00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.165
we left off the CSS for this one.

35
00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:07.057
Now it's like 40, okay.

36
00:02:07.057 --> 00:02:13.202
So lets,

37
00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:19.655
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

38
00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:23.255
so before we had flexbox,

39
00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:28.171
let me see if I can make the flexbox.

40
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:28.956
I'm gonna go like that.

41
00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:33.538
Okay, so I'm just gonna go to these
two slides until we can catch up,

42
00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:36.463
because there is a typo
in one of the slides.

43
00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:39.584
Okay, so
here we have structural selectors.

44
00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:43.875
And the first-child, and
the last-child, are both bold.

45
00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:47.759
We have 10, what number is the first,
and the last?

46
00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.313
1, and 10.

47
00:02:49.313 --> 00:02:51.578
So 1 and 10 are both bold.

48
00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:55.679
Then we have the first-of-type,
and the last-of-type.

49
00:02:55.679 --> 00:03:02.254
The only thing that can be a descendant
of an ordered, or unordered list,

50
00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:07.783
is an li, so it matches the first-child,
and last-child.

51
00:03:07.783 --> 00:03:10.318
But it could've been,
if we had done paragraphs in H1s,

52
00:03:10.318 --> 00:03:11.681
it would've been different.

53
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:16.659
Then we have nth-child(even),
background color, gray.

54
00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.639
And so you'll notice that 2, 4, 6, 8,
and 10 have a background color of gray.

55
00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.166
And then it says, nth-child(3).

56
00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:33.185
So just the third one,
make it gray, as in the color.

57
00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:39.985
And so you'll see, all of them are black
or blue, except for number 3 is gray.

58
00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:43.610
And then it says,
nth-of-type(odd), make it white.

59
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.042
We'll just make it striped,
I could've made it a different color.

60
00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:48.148
And then, nth-of-type(4n).

61
00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:50.485
So that means every 4th.

62
00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:53.820
So it's number 4, number 8,
if we had continued,

63
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.509
it would've been number 12,
number 16, number 20, number 24.

64
00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.366
So that's 4n.

65
00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:04.716
And in the last equation says, 3n-1.

66
00:04:04.716 --> 00:04:11.637
So we start with n being 0, and
3n-1 is negative 1, so that doesn't count.

67
00:04:11.637 --> 00:04:17.732
Then we say, if n was 1,
it would be 3 times 1 is 3, minus 1 is 2.

68
00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:24.135
And then if n was 2, it would be 2
times 3, which is 6, minus one is five.

69
00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:25.811
Who said you didn't need to know math.

70
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:27.144
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right?

71
00:04:27.144 --> 00:04:31.031
So we have number 2, number 5, number 8.

72
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:35.198
And it would have also
continued on to number 11, and

73
00:04:35.198 --> 00:04:39.648
continued at item of making
those aligned right.

74
00:04:39.648 --> 00:04:42.653
Do people understand the equation of an+b?

75
00:04:42.653 --> 00:04:47.000
Okay, so before we had flexbox,

76
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.435
you could do stupid pet tricks like this,

77
00:04:52.435 --> 00:04:55.541
which is you could say,

78
00:04:55.541 --> 00:05:00.354
the element that is only of its type,

79
00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:04.104
give it a width of 100%.

80
00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:09.041
So the first element would
be the first of its type.

81
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:13.343
And the last of its, nth,
last of its type, starting from the end.

82
00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:16.790
So here, I'm showing you last-of-type.

83
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.848
We have not started from the end before.

84
00:05:18.848 --> 00:05:22.304
So nth-last-of-type() says start at
the end, and then do the equation.

85
00:05:22.304 --> 00:05:27.263
So en element that is both
the first of it's type, and

86
00:05:27.263 --> 00:05:33.232
the second from the end,
means there's exactly two elements.

87
00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:37.737
This next line says nth-of-type(2), which
means it's the second element, right?

88
00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:45.772
And is also the last of it's type, right?

89
00:05:45.772 --> 00:05:48.035
That means it's exactly 2,
but it's the second one.

90
00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:49.789
So make those both 50%.

91
00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.080
And then going on to the fourth one,

92
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.015
it says nth-of-type(1),
nth-last-of-type(4).

93
00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:02.847
So it's basically saying something
that is the first one, and

94
00:06:02.847 --> 00:06:06.474
forth from the end,
which means it's exactly 4, right?

95
00:06:06.474 --> 00:06:08.187
Make it 25%.

96
00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:10.915
So this is what we could
do before we had flexbox.

97
00:06:10.915 --> 00:06:13.068
But later on today,
we're gonna cover flexbox.

98
00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:15.368
So we don't need to use
these stupid pet tricks.

99
00:06:15.368 --> 00:06:21.820
But I just did wanna show you that
you can put two things together,

100
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.759
you can string selectors along like that,
okay.

101
00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:32.660
So I believe we are back to here, yes.

102
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.883
So here, feel free to take two minutes,
or three minutes,

103
00:06:37.883 --> 00:06:41.856
let's do three minutes, to play with this.
