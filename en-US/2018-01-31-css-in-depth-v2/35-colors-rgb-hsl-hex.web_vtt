1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.320
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, colors.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.010
All these colors have the exact
same value, they're all white.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.044
So you can declare it white, you can
have a three-digit hexadecimal value,

4
00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.523
a six-digit hexadecimal value, and

5
00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:18.110
you can also have an eight-digit
hexadecimal value.

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.390
This might be new to some people, but
the six characters are basically the white

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.150
from above, and
the last two Fs means 100% opaque.

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.470
So we now have a digit hexadecimal
values will has to be, so

9
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.000
it's RGBA, is basically what it is.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.130
Then we have RGB, which is red, green,
blue, and you can either use zero,

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.460
to 255 or
you can use percents from 0 to 100.

12
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.750
You cannot combine the two,
that is incorrect.

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.200
You can't put percents on some and
0 to 255 on the other.

14
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.060
So then we have RGBA,
which is the same thing but

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.970
with the last value being the opacity.

16
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.726
In this case we're trying to get to one,
so it's 100% opaque, or 1.

17
00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:09.354
Then we have hsl and hsla, which is hue,
saturation, and lightness,

18
00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:15.084
which if you use Photoshop it's similar to
hue, saturation and brightness, I think?

19
00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.350
Yeah, hsb.

20
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.240
And we have hsla, which is the same thing
but with an alphatransparency at the end.

21
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.110
And then we have two other things which is

22
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.770
the key term of transparent and
the key term of currentColor.

23
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.430
currentColor is the current
color of the text.

24
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.448
So let's go first to the white,
which is the name key terms.

25
00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:48.458
We've got a bunch of them in CSS 2 and
CSS 3 or in CSS 2.

26
00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:53.626
The only one that was added
since then is Rebecca Purple.

27
00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:57.302
So the coauthor of this book, Eric Myer,

28
00:01:57.302 --> 00:02:02.100
his daughter passed away
on her sixth birthday.

29
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.930
And because he's the Oprah of CSS, and his

30
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.640
duaghter's name was Rebecca and
her favorite color was purple,

31
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.680
in his honor they actually, and
it was a color that was not yet used.

32
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.700
So I believe it's 536.

33
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.190
It's one of my favorite colors actually,
it's 639 rather.

34
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.417
So that's the only that's been
added since the original.

35
00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:28.371
Then, we have currentColor.

36
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:35.837
And currentColor is a special color, and
it's uses a default for a lot of things.

37
00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:42.190
So if you do boarder, and do border solid,
three pixels or just border solid.

38
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.200
When you do a border, we'll cover that
later, but borders you have to declare

39
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.480
what type of border it is and
that's all you have to declare.

40
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.150
The other two values are default.

41
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.340
They default to medium, which is
three pixels wide in most browsers.

42
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.597
And it default to currentColor as
the color, which is the color of the text.

43
00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:06.860
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's other
name color such as current color,

44
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.910
which I've become deprecated.

45
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.214
So these will work in a lot of browsers
and they're just here for legacy reasons,

46
00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:17.225
just to remind you like if you actually
hit this This was valid at one point.

47
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:21.990
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then we have RGB and
RGBA.

48
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.210
So all colors, well, that's not true.

49
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.790
All colors used to be RGB, whether it was
hexadecimal notation or RGB notation.

50
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.320
Now we have HSL, which is different.

51
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.685
And we also had CMKY, which is cyan,
magenta, which is for print.

52
00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:42.089
I don't know if that still exists or not.

53
00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:48.074
So, when we have hexadecimal notation,
the first two digits are the red,

54
00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:53.779
the second two digits are the green,
the third two digits are the blue.

55
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.580
Similarly, when we have RGB,
it stands for red, green, blue.

56
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.390
That's what the r, and
g, and the b stand for.

57
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.430
As I said earlier, you can have it with
numbers from 0 to 255 with 0 being black,

58
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.840
or complete lack of color and
255 being a complete saturation of color.

59
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.790
Or you can do percents,

60
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.200
with 0 being complete lack of color and
100% being complete saturation.

61
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.490
And then we can also add an alpha
transparency if we add the a at the end.

62
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.724
So in this case,
I used percents on latter one and

63
00:04:30.724 --> 00:04:34.561
0 through 255 on the prior one.

64
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:37.324
Again, you can't mix those up.

65
00:04:37.324 --> 00:04:42.174
And what I could have done
there as well is put 40, BF,

66
00:04:42.174 --> 00:04:45.588
AC, like CC or something like that.

67
00:04:45.588 --> 00:04:52.260
No, 66 probably, for 0.2,
I don't know what 0.2 actually is.

68
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.960
But, I could have put those eight digit
codes, but we'll cover that in a second.

69
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.540
Then we have HSLA colors which are hue,
saturation,

70
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.050
lightness and alpha transparency.

71
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.480
So the hues go from 0 which is red,

72
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.250
through to orange,
through to yellow, I passed yellow.

73
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.953
Yellow's in there somewhere.

74
00:05:20.368 --> 00:05:26.740
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Through to green,
and blue, and purple, and back to red.

75
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.910
So this right here,
that thing right there,

76
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.500
is actually 360 separate spans with each
color in there, that's how I did that.

77
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.120
I could have just used a gradient, but

78
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.634
why make things easier when
I can put 360 divs in there.

79
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:49.580
Saturation, 100% saturation means
full of color and 0% saturation

80
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.849
is always going to be a grey cuz it means
the color's completely non saturated.

81
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.294
Generally, you wanna
go with the 100 there.

82
00:05:57.294 --> 00:06:04.657
And lightness, 100% is always gonna
be white, 0 is always gonna be black,

83
00:06:04.657 --> 00:06:09.872
and 50% is kind of the midpoint
of super bright color.

84
00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:17.368
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then alpha
transparency you have fully opaque and

85
00:06:17.368 --> 00:06:19.360
somewhat transparent.

86
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.840
And the reason that you can still
see HSLA colors right there,

87
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.130
is because I have text shadow on there.

88
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:33.790
So I have a color that is alpha
transparent but the text shadow is not.

89
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.460
So box shadows are actually
just shadows on the outside or

90
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.720
on the inside of an element.

91
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.732
Whereas text shadow is actually behind
the whole text, it's a copy of the text in

92
00:06:44.732 --> 00:06:48.814
the shadow form and you can move it, but
it's actually a shadow of the whole text.

93
00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:53.880
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

94
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.216
then I have this little converter that
I reprogrammed it for this talk and

95
00:06:59.216 --> 00:07:04.870
I hope that it works, cuz it worked
a month ago when I reprogrammed it.

96
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.498
It takes a long time to make 702 slides.

97
00:07:07.498 --> 00:07:12.502
So here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I change

98
00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:18.199
the alpha transparency,
I can actually figure out what 0.2 is.

99
00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.010
0.2 is 33.

100
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.760
Remember when I was
trying to figure it out?

101
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.570
So here is my color converter.

102
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.610
I have a GitHub repo,
you can use it, it's open source.

103
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.370
It basically allows you to
pick any color you want and

104
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.780
any alpha transparency you want.

105
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.169
But do you need this?

106
00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:41.079
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let me
show you a cool feature,

107
00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:44.730
lets me go alpha transparency there, okay.

108
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:50.340
I'm going to go and check my inspector,
I'm going to go look

109
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.530
at this div here, and it says the
background color is rgb(245, 148, 148).

110
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.731
That's what it says, right?

111
00:07:57.731 --> 00:08:00.354
Okay, cool, we got it right, but

112
00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:04.547
if I open this up,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It gives

113
00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:05.711
me the information here.

114
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:11.527
And I can actually convert it to HSLA and
hexadecimal right there.

115
00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:15.885
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
you actually have a full-on color picker

116
00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:17.109
in your developer tools.

117
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.770
Which is how I picked the hideous
colors on the back of this slide deck.

118
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.790
So I would pick a color, open it up,
and then pick another color

119
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.070
that I thought was nice,
clashes just enough to make it hideous.

120
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.252
And then that's how I picked the colors.

121
00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:39.090
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's get out of here, okay.

122
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.816
Another feature in here is, yeah,

123
00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:49.300
you see I use Rebecca Purple a lot.

124
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.447
This is the Rebecca Purple
in royal blue deck and

125
00:08:54.447 --> 00:09:02.504
if I click on this text right here and,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I go down to color,

126
00:09:08.717 --> 00:09:09.633
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Anyone seeing color?

127
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.264
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Color,
if I open this up here,

128
00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:16.550
do you see that white line right there?

129
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.100
That is an accessibility feature.

130
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.870
If I wanna make sure that
I have enough contrast,

131
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:28.000
which currently my contrast is at 11.9,
which is serious contrast.

132
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.940
But if I pick this color here,
it'll say low contrast.

133
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.140
So actually, if you wanna make sure
that you're site is accessible,

134
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.834
there's accessibility features.

135
00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:42.017
But actually it's separate accessibility
features, but within this right here,

136
00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:46.105
if you're gonna pick a color,
pick one that's below the line, so

137
00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:50.857
that you know that you have enough color
contrast for people with low vision.

138
00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:53.095
Okay, so then we have RGBA.

139
00:09:53.095 --> 00:09:54.700
So you saw that we use RGBA here.

140
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.140
Let me just update this, so
that we're actually on track, okay.

141
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.849
RGBA is the red, the green,
the blue, and the alpha.

142
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.610
And these are the different values.

143
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.379
So 20% is 33.

144
00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:13.155
75% is bf.

145
00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:15.996
And then we have, can I use.

146
00:10:15.996 --> 00:10:21.990
Oops, and so far,
it does not work in IE or Edge.

147
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.360
And it's coming soon, I guess,
in the Samsung Internet browser.

148
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.945
But it's working in Firefox,
Chrome, and Safari.

149
00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:38.508
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Did I tell you we
were gonna make ugly stuff today?

150
00:10:38.508 --> 00:10:41.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This qualifies.

151
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.632
Okay, so change the colors above.

152
00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:50.180
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: What
does currentColor do?

153
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.710
So the background,
the color is this, right?

154
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.020
And then I said, or the color rather,
is this form of pink.

155
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.940
So let's just call it pink.

156
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.260
Because I can't really read HSL
because I'm not a designer.

157
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.640
So the thing is, the background,

158
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.770
did you see how the background
changed to pink when I did that?

159
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.350
So let's see royal blue.

160
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.810
So I'm changing the color and
then the currentColor change value,

161
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.802
so the background change value
because the currentColor change value.

162
00:11:26.994 --> 00:11:32.910
So, currentColor is whatever
color the foreground color or

163
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.130
the text color is at this time.

164
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.897
So, if I did border solid,

165
00:11:39.897 --> 00:11:48.160
it's going to be that currentColor, right?

166
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.550
If I said border solid 3 pixels,
it stays the same because the default is.

167
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:58.450
And then if I do currentcolor,
it stays the same.

168
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.179
But if I change this to green,
the border is gonna change because I use

169
00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:04.768
current color and
it's whenever the color is.

170
00:12:04.768 --> 00:12:11.518
Okay, so a few tips,
transparent is RGBA to transparent block.

171
00:12:11.518 --> 00:12:14.256
currentColor is the current text color.

172
00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:16.813
Accessibility, color should never

173
00:12:16.813 --> 00:12:21.275
be the only visual means of
providing information to your user.

174
00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:25.595
So if your text is black, and
your links are dark green and

175
00:12:25.595 --> 00:12:29.800
they're not underlined,
some people can't see it.

176
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.180
If your text is red and
your links are green, you have no taste.

177
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.550
But also, some people can't read
it because they're color blind.

178
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.590
It's either low vision
needs a high contrast.

179
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.780
Or a lot of people have,
10% of men, have colorblindness.

180
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.570
And I used to ask sometimes in sessions,
is anyone here colorblind?

181
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.536
And apparently, that is not a polite thing
to ask, so I don't ask that anymore.

182
00:12:57.932 --> 00:12:59.538
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then appearance, well,

183
00:12:59.538 --> 00:13:01.601
I have no clue why this is on the slide.

184
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:06.300
But it's a good segue, so
it's probably gonna come up next.

185
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.096
Appearance is a property that allows you
to change the appearance of elements.

186
00:13:11.096 --> 00:13:13.176
So by default, the browser will say,

187
00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:16.044
like the appearance of
a button looks like a button.

188
00:13:16.044 --> 00:13:19.790
And you can actually use
appearance to change that.

189
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:26.366
So, we've talked about alpha transparency,
which is very different than opacity.
