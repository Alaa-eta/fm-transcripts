1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.340
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So colors, all these
colors have the exact same value.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.010
They're all white.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.110
So you can declare it white.

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.710
You can have a three
digits hexadecimal value.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.620
A six digit hexadecimal value and

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.110
you can also have an eight
digit hexadecimal value.

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.390
This might be new to some people but
the six characters are basically the white

8
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.150
from above, and
the last two f's means a 100% opaque.

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.290
So we now have eight digit hexadecimal
values that will last two being,

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.000
it's what rgba, it's basically what it is.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.130
Then we have rgb which red, green,
or blue and you can either use 0

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.460
to 255, or
you can use percents from 0 to 100.

13
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.750
You cannot combine the two,
that is incorrect.

14
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.200
You can't put percents on some and
0 to 255 on the other.

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.060
So then we have RGBA,
which is the same thing but

16
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.970
with the last value being the opacity.

17
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.050
In this case, we're trying to get to 1,
so it's a 100% opaque or 1.

18
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.320
Then we have HSL and HSLA, which is hue,
saturation, and lightness.

19
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.120
Which if you use Photoshop, is similar to
hue, saturation, and brightness, I think.

20
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.610
Yeah, HSB, and

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.240
we have HSLA, which is the same thing but
with a alpha transparent at the end.

22
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.730
And then we have two other things,

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.770
which is this key term of transparent and
the key term of current color.

24
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.430
Current color is the current
color of the text.

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.610
So let's go first to the white,
which is the name key terms.

26
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.740
We've got a bunch of them in CSS 2 and
CSS 3, or in CSS 2.

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.490
The only one that was added
since then was Rebecca Purple.

28
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.600
So the co author of this book,
Eric Myer, his

29
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.380
daughter passed away on her sixth birthday
and because he's the Oprah of CSS.

30
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.640
And his daughter's name was Rebecca and
her favorite color was purple.

31
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.680
In his honor, they actually,
it was a color that was not yet used.

32
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.730
So I believe it's 536, it's one of my
favorite colors actually, it's 639 rather.

33
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.300
So that's the only one that's
been added since the original.

34
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.760
Then we have currentColor and
currentColor is a special color and

35
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.120
it's no matter what color and
it uses the default for a lot of things.

36
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.190
So like if you do border and you do 3 or
4 solid 3 pixels or just border solid.

37
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.200
When you do a border, we'll cover that
later, but borders you have to declare

38
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.880
what type of border it is and
that's all you have to declare.

39
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.150
The other 2 values are default.

40
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.362
They default to medium which is 3
pixels wide in most browsers and

41
00:02:56.362 --> 00:02:59.013
they default to current
color to the color,

42
00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:04.188
which is the color of the text.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's

43
00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:08.910
other name colors, such as current color,
which have become deprecated.

44
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.590
So these will work in a lot of browsers,
and they're just here for legacy reasons.

45
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.663
Just to remind you if you
actually hit this was valid at

46
00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:21.428
one point.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then we have RGB and

47
00:03:21.428 --> 00:03:21.990
RGBA.

48
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.210
So all colors, well that's not true.

49
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.790
All colors used to be RGB, whether it was
hexadecimal notation or RGB notation.

50
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.540
Now we have HSL which is different and
we also had CMKY,

51
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.750
which is cyan-magenta, which is for print.

52
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.056
I don't know if that still exists or not.

53
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:47.880
So our RG, when we have hexadecimal
notation, the first two digits

54
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.710
are the red, the second two digits are the
green, the third two digits are the blue.

55
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.260
Similarly when we have RGB, it stands for
red, green, blue and that's what the R,

56
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.390
G and the B stand for.

57
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.160
As I said earlier, you can have
it with numbers, from 0 to 255.

58
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.580
With 0 being black or
complete lack of color and

59
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.840
255 being complete saturation of color.

60
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.790
Or you can do percents,

61
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.540
which 0 being a complete lack of color and
100% being complete saturation, and

62
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.490
then we can also add an alpha
transparency if we add the a at the end.

63
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.060
So in this case,
I use percents on the latter one, and

64
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.830
0 through 255 on the prior one,
again, you can't mix those up.

65
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.310
And what I could have done

66
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.710
there as well is put 40 bfac,
like cc or something like that.

67
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.490
No, 66, probably, for 0.2,
I don't know what 0.2 actually is,

68
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.960
but I could've put those 8 digit colors,
but we'll cover that in a second.

69
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.830
Then we have HSLA colors,

70
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.050
which are hue, saturation,
lightness, and alpha transparency.

71
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.950
So the hues go from zero, which is red,

72
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.480
through to orange, through to yellow.

73
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.250
I passed yellow.

74
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.520
Yellow's in there somewhere, yeah.

75
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.740
Through to green and blue and
purple and back to red.

76
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.165
So, this right here,
that thing right there, is actually

77
00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:35.500
360 separate spams with each color
in there that's how I did that.

78
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.120
I could have just used a gradient but

79
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.241
why make things easy when I can
put 360 [INAUDIBLE] in there.

80
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.420
Saturation, 100% saturation means
full of color and 0% saturation

81
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.849
always gonna be a gray cuz it means
the color is completely not saturated.

82
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.522
Generally you want to go with
a hundred there, and lightness,

83
00:05:59.522 --> 00:06:02.330
100% percent is always going to be white.

84
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.035
0 is always going to be black,

85
00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:10.130
50% percent is the midpoint
of super bright color.

86
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.360
Then, alpha transparency you have
fully opaque and somewhat transparent.

87
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.840
And the reason that you can still
see HSLA Colors right there

88
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.130
is because I have text shadow on there.

89
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:33.790
So I have a color that is alpha
transparent, but the text shadow is not.

90
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.460
So, box shadows, or
actually just shadows on the outside or

91
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.720
on the inside of an element.

92
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.528
Whereas text shadow is actually
behind the whole text,

93
00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:46.871
it's a copy of the whole text in
the shadow form and can move it, but

94
00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:53.694
it's actually shadow of the whole text.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

95
00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:59.125
then I have this little converter that
I reprogrammed it for this talk and

96
00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:04.470
I hope that it works cause it worked
a month ago when I reprogrammed it.

97
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.490
It takes a long time to make 702 slides.

98
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.330
So here,
if I change the alpha transparency.

99
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.915
I can actually figure out what 0.2 is.

100
00:07:18.915 --> 00:07:20.010
0.2 is 33.

101
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.760
Remember when I was
trying to figure it out?

102
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.570
So here is my color converter.

103
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.100
I have a GitHub repo.

104
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.790
You can use it.

105
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.610
It's open-source.

106
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.370
It basically allows you to
pick any color you want and

107
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.949
any alpha transparency you want,
but do you need this?

108
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.350
Let me show a cool feature.

109
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.520
Let me go to alpha transparency there.

110
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.780
Okay, I'm gonna go and check my inspector.

111
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.540
I'm gonna go look at the div here, and

112
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.519
it says the background color is RGB 245,
148, 148.

113
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.990
That's what it says, right?

114
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.510
Okay cool we got it right but if I open
this up, it gives me the information here,

115
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.870
and I can actually convert it to HAOA and
hexadecimal right there.

116
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.109
So you actually have a full color
picker in your developer tools.

117
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.770
Which is how I pick the hideous colors
on the back of this slide deck.

118
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.830
So I would pick a color, open it up, and

119
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.320
then pick another color that
I thought was [INAUDIBLE].

120
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.580
Clashes just enough to make it hideous,
and then that's how I pick the colors.

121
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.994
So let's get out of here, okay.

122
00:08:39.994 --> 00:08:44.083
Another feature in here

123
00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:48.258
[NOISE] is,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah you see I use

124
00:08:48.258 --> 00:08:49.108
Rebecca purple a lot.

125
00:08:49.108 --> 00:08:54.105
This is Rebecca purple and
royal blue deck and

126
00:08:54.105 --> 00:08:57.919
if I click on this text right here,

127
00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:02.012
and,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I go down to

128
00:09:02.012 --> 00:09:09.165
color.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Anyone

129
00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:13.004
seen color?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Color,

130
00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:16.550
if I open this up here,
you see that white line right there?

131
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.100
That in an accessibility feature.

132
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.870
If I want to make sure that
I have enough contrast.

133
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:28.140
Which currently my contrast is at 11.9,
which is serious contrast, but

134
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.940
if I pick this color here,
it'll say low contrast.

135
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.090
So there's actually if you want to make
sure that your site is accessible, there's

136
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.500
accessibility features, but there's an
actually separate accessibility features.

137
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.180
But within this right here,
if you're going to pick a color.

138
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.810
Pick one that's below the line so

139
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.150
that you know that you have enough color
contrast for people with low vision.

140
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.360
Okay, so then we have RGBA.

141
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.110
You saw that we used RGBA here.

142
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.582
Let me just update so
that we're actually on track, okay.

143
00:09:58.582 --> 00:10:03.307
[INAUDIBLE] is the red,
the green, the blue, and

144
00:10:03.307 --> 00:10:08.043
the alpha, and
these are the different values.

145
00:10:08.043 --> 00:10:13.555
So 20% is 33.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 75% is BF,

146
00:10:13.555 --> 00:10:18.590
and then we have can I use, oops.

147
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.917
And so far, it does not work in IE or
Edge, and it's coming soon, I guess,

148
00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:29.504
in the Samsung internet browser, but
it's working in Firefox, Chrome, and

149
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:36.936
Safari.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Did I tell

150
00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.664
you we're going to make ugly stuff today?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

151
00:10:39.664 --> 00:10:41.330
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This qualifies.

152
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:49.006
Okay, so change the colors above.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: What

153
00:10:49.006 --> 00:10:50.180
does currentColor do?

154
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.710
So the background,
the color is this, right?

155
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.130
And then I said, or the color,
rather, is this form of pink, so

156
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.940
let's just call it pink.

157
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.260
Because I can't read HSL
because I'm not a designer.

158
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.640
So the thing is the background,

159
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.770
did you see how the background
changed to pink when I did that?

160
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.350
So let's see royal blue.

161
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.810
So I'm changing the color and
then the current color changed value.

162
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.870
So the background changed value because
the current color changed value.

163
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:32.850
So current color is what ever
color the foreground color,

164
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.000
or the text color, is at this time.

165
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.940
So if I did border

166
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:48.160
solid, it's good to be that current color,
right?

167
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.550
If I said border solid three pixels,
it stays the same, because the default it,

168
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:58.450
and if I do current color,
it stays the same.

169
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.980
But if I change this to green,
the border is going to change because I

170
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:08.030
use current color which
is whatever the color is.

171
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.150
Okay, so a few tips, transparent
is RGB 80 is a transparent black.

172
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.850
Current color is a current text color.

173
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.666
Accessibility, color should never be
the only means of providing information to

174
00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:21.960
your user.

175
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.600
So if your text is black and

176
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.800
your links are dark green and
not underlined, some people can't see it.

177
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.647
If your text is red and your links
are green, you have no taste, but

178
00:12:33.647 --> 00:12:37.451
also some people can't read it,
because they're color blind.

179
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:41.160
It's either low vision
needs high contrast, or

180
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.055
a lot of people have,
10 percent of men have color blindness.

181
00:12:46.055 --> 00:12:48.691
I used ask sometimes in sessions is
if anyone here is colorblind and

182
00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:50.860
apparently that is not
a polite thing to ask.

183
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:58.307
So I don't ask that anymore.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

184
00:12:58.307 --> 00:13:02.390
then appearance,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I have no clue why this

185
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.550
is on this slide, but it's a good segue,
so it's probably gonna come up next.

186
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.740
Appearance is a property that allows you
to change the appearance of elements.

187
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.320
So by default, the browser will say the
appearance of a button looks like a button

188
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.790
and you can actually use
appearance to change that.

189
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:26.935
So we've talked about alpha transparency
which is very different than opacity.
