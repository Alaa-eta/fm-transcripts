>> Estelle Weyl: So let's go onto the direction. Basically everything so far has been top to bottom, except for the ones that weren't editable which went from left to right. So you can declare the direction. So let's first start by discussing when you say to and either give a side or a corner.

[00:00:21]
So the options are to top, to bottom and to bottom is the default, to left, to right, to top left, to top right, to bottom left and to bottom right. In this example here, this is the midpoint and I'm gonna say to bottom, which is the default. And so that gradient line goes from top to bottom.

[00:00:47]

>> Estelle Weyl: If I say to left, you'll see it's going from the first color to cleared, of purple, to a golden run. It's going from the right to the left. Now, it's gonna go from the left to the right. It's basically going to right. And then I can have it go to top.

[00:01:14]
Fairly simple, right? Now I'm gonna say to top left. And if you see the midpoint of that gradient, right, is going from the bottom corner to the top corner, right? And the gradient line that's along, like if I'd given 15 different colors it would go along that line.

[00:01:41]
So everything's going along that line. It's perpendicular to the midpoint.
>> Estelle Weyl: To top right. They're called magic corners, which is the 50% mark, goes from this corner right here, if it didn't have a border radius, to this corner right here if it didn't have a border radius. And it's a little off, no it's not actually, it's perfectly fine, okay.

[00:02:06]
So basically that's whats going on. Your gradient line is at a right angle to the midpoint of a line that goes from one corner to the other corner. So it's going from the top, in this case it's going to the bottom right, so it's starting up here and going down here.

[00:02:28]
So it is going in the general direction in the bottom right. But it's going in the general direction so that the perpendicular line would go from corner to corner.
>> Estelle Weyl: So let's try this. Just write all of them, to right, to left, to bottom right.
>> Estelle Weyl: And let's just do 50%.

[00:02:56]
50%. You see how that green line, that yellow, green change goes from corner to corner? But the gradient line, so the gradient line is the line that's going from red to orange to yellow to green to blue to purple. So it's actually going from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.

[00:03:17]
But it's not actually hitting either corner, it's going in such a way that it's perpendicular to the line that goes from the bottom left to the top right, does that make sense?
>> Estelle Weyl: So now let's discuss angles. So we've been declaring everything with key terms, now we can learn how to do it with angles.

[00:03:40]

>> Estelle Weyl: The degrees go, starting at 12 noon or at the top, which is 0%. The right is 90%, the bottom is 180, and the left is 270. So 0 degrees is the same as top, but 45 degrees is not the same as top right. Because 45 degrees will always be 45 degrees.

[00:04:13]
But top right might be at a different angle depending on the aspect ratio.
>> Estelle Weyl: And the degree is required. You don't have to use degrees. You can use radians or grads. But no one uses radiants or grads, so we're not really gonna cover them, but you can actually play with it, and it's fine.

[00:04:30]
So here, right there, I made it 216 degrees.
>> Estelle Weyl: And so the degrees is
>> Estelle Weyl: 0 degrees is actually where the black line goes, right? It's going 0 degrees, it's going up and down. And then the gradient follows that gradient line.
>> Estelle Weyl: And so let's just click on 45 degrees, right?

[00:05:02]
That's 45 degrees. And then let's do top right. So you see, it's slightly different.
>> Estelle Weyl: And just to reiterate the point between 45 degrees. The one that says 45 degrees, the angle is, that gradient is never gonna change. The box is gonna get taller or shorter, but it's not gonna change the angle whereas the top right will actually change its location.

[00:05:27]
So you see, the 45 degree is that angle is still exactly the way it was, whereas the gradient line in the two top right is almost vertical. And here it's closer to horizontal, where as this one is still 45 degrees. So two top right and 45 degrees aren't actually different.

[00:05:45]
So one of the questions that I got was, can you animate it? And I did it once. So I did this website called, The School for Machines Who Can't Learn Good and Wanna Do Other Stuff Good Too. And there's two Easter eggs on this page. One is the white twitch, and then the other one is an animated radio gradient.

[00:06:09]
And it doesn't animate very well.
>> Estelle Weyl: So it is possible to animate but it's kind of not the best thing to do. So let's move on and continue on gradients. And we will actually talk about maybe animating a gradient when we talk about animations later on.
