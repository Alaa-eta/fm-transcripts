1
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.170
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's talk about border-radius.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.180
In the upper right-hand corner, we have
border-radius is 0, which is the default.

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.480
I put two different colors on it so
that you could see where the angles are.

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.090
And when we learned how to make triangles
or looked to making triangles yesterday

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.430
with generated content, that was the
power, we could actually use those angles.

6
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.320
The thing is when you're
doing border-radius,

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.130
you start getting kind
of funky looking stuff.

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.970
Like the border radius at 20 pixels and

9
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.690
the border radius at 50 pixels,
it's just a little bit weird.

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.959
So do not prefix border-radius.

11
00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:45.098
I see [INAUDIBLE] border-radius in so
many different things and

12
00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:48.542
I think it's been supported
since Firefox 3.6.

13
00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:51.846
Who here is still supporting Firefox 3.6?

14
00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:57.376
Right, so why do I see [INAUDIBLE]
border-radius all over the place?

15
00:00:57.376 --> 00:01:01.892
You also don't wanna use webkit
border-radius cuz even though

16
00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:05.994
Android 2.3 still needs it,
it slows the device down.

17
00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:09.903
So a person is already on a crappy device
and you're just making it a lot worse.

18
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:14.958
So don't ever prefix this and
I believe last year on the SaaS homepage,

19
00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.160
where I was showing you
how to use functions,

20
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.910
it actually expanded adding Moz
border-radius and I'm kinda like, please.

21
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.369
So when you're using pre-processors or

22
00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.860
post-processors, make sure you're not
adding croft when you don't need it.

23
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.195
Okay, so to make a circle,

24
00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:37.243
you need to have an element that
has the same height and width.

25
00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:39.768
Otherwise, it's going to be an ellipse.

26
00:01:39.768 --> 00:01:43.223
But if you wanna make an elipse or
a circle, and

27
00:01:43.223 --> 00:01:47.935
a circle is a type of elipse,
just use border-radius 50%.

28
00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:54.021
If you put two values, it's different
than putting two values with a slash.

29
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:58.928
So in the third example,
we have border-radius 10 pixels,

30
00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:03.095
30 pixels which means
the upper left hand corner and

31
00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:08.188
the bottom right hand corner have
a border radius of 10 pixels,

32
00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:12.911
and the upper right hand corner and
the lower left hand corner

33
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:17.910
have a radius of 30 pixels which
is much prettier than the thing

34
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.108
we are doing next which
is 10 pixels / 30 pixels.

35
00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:28.538
That's basically saying, horizontally,
make the border-radius 30 pixels and

36
00:02:28.538 --> 00:02:33.099
vertically, make it 10 pixels,
or the other way around.

37
00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.413
And then we can do really ugly stuff,
cuz we can put all four values.

38
00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:39.697
The bottom one, that's ugly.

39
00:02:39.697 --> 00:02:41.751
That's called uglification.

40
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:44.943
And it's something we're
learning a lot about today.

41
00:02:44.943 --> 00:02:50.806
That's how to make an ugly thing,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: On the web.

42
00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:55.987
So that's saying basically,
the upper left-hand is

43
00:02:55.987 --> 00:03:01.739
10 pixels by 30 pixels,
the upper right is 35 by 35.

44
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.550
The bottom right is 20 by 5 and
the bottom left is 15 by 5,

45
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.140
and that's just ugly but you can do that.

46
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.380
So just realize that that's
what border-radius is doing.

47
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.460
So let's just play with border-radius for
45 seconds.

48
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.510
Try to make this as ugly as possible.

49
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.080
Another thing to note on this,
as you're making this ugly,

50
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.120
is you see the original
corner would have been here.

51
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.790
And that's where this is going.

52
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.250
It's going to that mark right there.

53
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.664
So it's actually cutting off.

54
00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:36.989
It's on the bottom edge.

55
00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:41.449
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because your
borde- radius will curve in but

56
00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.000
your colors will stay angled.

57
00:03:52.911 --> 00:03:54.771
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
if you just get rid of the slash,

58
00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:56.695
that's actually not ugly anymore.

59
00:03:59.662 --> 00:04:04.395
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So realize that the slash
is in the syntax and now that you know it,

60
00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:07.164
let's see if we even use it anywhere.

61
00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.963
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now all of
the examples with slashes are ugly.

62
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:22.829
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And the thing is if
you're going to use the shorthand or

63
00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:29.998
the longhand of a border,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or

64
00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:35.390
is it top left radius, top-right, yeah.

65
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.862
So if I wanna make this ugly,

66
00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:43.356
I actually just do 40% or 20%.

67
00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:47.074
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right?
That's ugly but

68
00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:51.824
when I have two different values,
the different value for vertical and

69
00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:57.066
horizontal, so the vertical is 20 pixels,
then the horizontal is 50%.

70
00:04:57.066 --> 00:05:00.809
There's no slash, so there's only slash
in the longhand, not in the shorthand.

71
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.970
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
let's go onto border images.

72
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.097
So what is a border image or
how is it supported?

73
00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.904
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Considering
it's been around,

74
00:05:17.904 --> 00:05:21.052
let's just show you how
long it's been around.

75
00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:22.296
Right?

76
00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:23.147
Forever.

77
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.660
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's
been around forever and

78
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.161
it's still prefixed.

79
00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:42.865
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's not
even looking like it's gonna

80
00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:44.247
lose its prefix anytime soon.

81
00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:49.666
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
let me just reload this page.

82
00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:52.558
Okay, so the border-image,

83
00:05:52.558 --> 00:05:58.346
the underlying properties
are the border-image-source,

84
00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:03.360
the slice, the width,
the outset, and the repeat.

85
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.294
And that's for the border-image
is actually the shorthand.

86
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.640
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay?

87
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.460
So unlike background image,
which is a long hand property,

88
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.300
border image is a short hand property.

89
00:06:21.306 --> 00:06:24.906
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: For it to work, you
actually have to have a border, cuz you

90
00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:29.703
have to have that width of that border to
say how wide you want your image to be.

91
00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:34.112
So here I have a really ugly image.

92
00:06:40.207 --> 00:06:46.675
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And I am stretching it
and I am repeating it and I'm rounding it.

93
00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:58.565
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And I think repeat or
stretch will look the best, okay,

94
00:06:58.565 --> 00:06:59.385
that looks good.

95
00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:03.705
So I have a background image that
looks like a tiny version of this.

96
00:07:05.015 --> 00:07:08.171
So why would I wanna use border-image?

97
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:13.788
Because I might want to use this
image 150,000 different sizes.

98
00:07:13.788 --> 00:07:16.728
But I always want those
corners to be the exact same.

99
00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:19.108
And then I like it to stretch in between.

100
00:07:19.108 --> 00:07:26.141
So that would be a use case of not making
150 different sizes of this image.

101
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:30.820
I could also just put background cover,
right?

102
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.470
But if I take it and I make it background
cover and I have something that's

103
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.380
500 pixels wide, those corners on the edge
are gonna stretch and I don't want that.

104
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.104
So that would be a use case for
border-image.

105
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.050
So here I'm stretching it cuz it's
a gradient and I want it to look tall.

106
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.086
If I repeated it in the middle,
I'm repeating that gradient and

107
00:07:53.086 --> 00:07:54.741
that doesn't look good.

108
00:07:56.525 --> 00:08:00.234
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I was doing a stamp,
if I had a picture of a stamp,

109
00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:04.220
all I would have to do is do
one repetition of the stamp.

110
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.150
And then I could actually make
that stamp repeat 100 times.

111
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.099
Cuz you know how stamps go
have a straight edge or

112
00:08:10.099 --> 00:08:12.617
they used to before they were stickers.

113
00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.522
Now I think they're just rectangular,
I'm not sure.

114
00:08:15.522 --> 00:08:17.682
I don't even know the last
time I used a stamp was,

115
00:08:17.682 --> 00:08:19.598
cuz I don't know the last
time I paid a bill.

116
00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:26.749
No, I pay all my bills online, so I'm very
happy to have my bank pay for the stamps.

117
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:30.666
Because they certainly don't
give me interest on my money.

118
00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:33.004
Okay, so I have these properties.

119
00:08:33.004 --> 00:08:37.475
Basically, the border-image-source
is the first one I declare,

120
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.104
which is the gradient image that I used.

121
00:08:40.104 --> 00:08:43.503
The border-image-slice
is up to four values.

122
00:08:43.503 --> 00:08:47.621
And I'm gonna show you in the next picture
a little bit better how it's explained.

123
00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:51.859
And then I have a border-image-width
which is going to be basically

124
00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:54.282
the same size as the width of my border.

125
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.538
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then I repeated,
round it or stretch it and

126
00:09:00.538 --> 00:09:05.445
I can't remember what the outset is cuz I
didn't use it, I don't think I need it.

127
00:09:08.678 --> 00:09:09.935
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah, I didn't use it.

128
00:09:09.935 --> 00:09:12.111
Okay, so here we have a very long cat.

129
00:09:19.932 --> 00:09:22.483
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right there is
basically width of the border is.

130
00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:27.138
You see the border width is
48 by 137 by 68 by 84 and

131
00:09:27.138 --> 00:09:33.610
in my border image I repeat that as
48 137 68 84 without the pixel units.

132
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.410
Then I can use the property of
fill to fill it or not fill it.

133
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.629
And my cat looks better filled.

134
00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:51.489
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then I stretch it,

135
00:09:51.489 --> 00:09:57.908
because if I repeat,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It looks really weird.

136
00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:03.340
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So I stretch it.

137
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.899
So what I'd like you to do is just take
two minutes to change the border sizes to

138
00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:11.296
play with basically both these screens.

139
00:10:13.845 --> 00:10:16.120
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
you have a little bit of an understanding.

140
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.327
This is actually the produced syntax
right here, so you can switch these.

141
00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.494
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And the URL is gradient,
so let’s see if I can find,

142
00:10:26.494 --> 00:10:30.176
while you do that,
I'm gonna find the URL of this image.

143
00:10:42.143 --> 00:10:44.622
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you see I used
the style here, right here, and

144
00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:46.570
I told you yesterday to not use style.

145
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.240
The reason I'm doing that is because
I'm actually doing sliders and

146
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.380
I'm dynamically reloading the page.

147
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.130
So it's my JavaScript that's doing it.

148
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.100
I would not do this in production but

149
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.910
this is an example as to how
to show you how to do this.

150
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.880
There is so much bad and evil code,
I'd say it's embarrassing.

151
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.200
But I don't get embarrased.

152
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.920
So this is the original image
that we stretched, okay?

153
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.940
So that's what you're stretching.

154
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.606
What you wanna do is you wanna
repreat this inner part but

155
00:11:16.606 --> 00:11:20.358
you wanna maintain these
little corners on the outside.

156
00:11:20.358 --> 00:11:23.243
So how

157
00:11:23.243 --> 00:11:28.237
big
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Does

158
00:11:28.237 --> 00:11:29.598
your gradient have to be.

159
00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:30.950
So let's actually go over here.

160
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.420
Oops.

161
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.760
And change this from longcat,
if you want to.

162
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.060
You don't have to.

163
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.830
And do that.

164
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:49.131
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So now I just
have the four corners except for

165
00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:53.341
I really wanna have about 10 pixels by

166
00:11:53.341 --> 00:11:57.951
10 pixels by 10 pixels by 10 pixels.

167
00:11:57.951 --> 00:11:59.223
Is that enough?

168
00:11:59.223 --> 00:12:00.037
Yeah.

169
00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:05.707
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then my old syntax,
cuz I have to look at things,

170
00:12:05.707 --> 00:12:07.885
cuz I don't know this by heart.

171
00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:17.773
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Is,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No, stretch.

172
00:12:24.558 --> 00:12:30.165
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

173
00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:31.744
So let's just copy this over here.

174
00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:41.683
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I'm gonna hit Return
right here cuz you can actually have

175
00:12:41.683 --> 00:12:44.813
things that are two lines long and
just do this.

176
00:12:47.386 --> 00:12:50.375
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So why does it
not have this stuff in the middle?

177
00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:52.051
Because I need to fill it.

178
00:12:54.933 --> 00:12:56.214
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
where do I put the fill?

179
00:12:58.416 --> 00:12:59.423
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I don't remember.

180
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.491
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: After the image URL.

181
00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:15.170
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There we go.

182
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:23.065
And let me do 30,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 30.

183
00:13:23.065 --> 00:13:27.920
I hope you're playing along cuz
I don't have to come all the way

184
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.056
to Minnesota to play with this,
I can do this at home.

185
00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:33.088
Okay.

186
00:13:33.088 --> 00:13:36.592
And width,

187
00:13:36.592 --> 00:13:40.801
60 pixels.

188
00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:45.506
Height, 80 pixels.

189
00:13:51.641 --> 00:14:01.336
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Box-sizing
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

190
00:14:01.336 --> 00:14:03.608
So now it's 60 pixels by 80 pixels.

191
00:14:07.365 --> 00:14:09.780
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Why don't
we make the width 160?

192
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:16.657
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 40 and then just do 20,

193
00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:20.600
20, 20, 20.

194
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.180
So you see how I can make that image
in no matter what size I make it,

195
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.370
it still looks ugly.

196
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.290
No matter what size I make it,

197
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.390
it still looks like it was
the original image of the button.

198
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.271
It's doesn't look like I completely
played around with that and stretched it.

199
00:14:35.271 --> 00:14:38.143
So that's border-image.

200
00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:42.943
One last thing I want to cover on
border-image, which I didn't cover before,

201
00:14:42.943 --> 00:14:45.177
is how the border-image is placed.

202
00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:49.149
Basically, when you were just
defining the widths of the borders,

203
00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:52.633
you were defining what was on the left,
what was on the top,

204
00:14:52.633 --> 00:14:55.572
what was on the right, and
what was on the bottom.

205
00:14:55.572 --> 00:15:00.132
And then you were placing or
slicing the background,

206
00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:04.310
that border-image, into nine parts.

207
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.540
The upper right hand part was put
in the upper right hand corner.

208
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.360
The upper left hand part was put
in the upper left hand corner.

209
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.945
The bottom right hand part was put
in the bottom right hand corner.

210
00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:15.390
And the bottom left hand part was
put in the bottom left hand corner.

211
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.990
And then the rest of it was stretched or
repeated.

212
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.740
So this is kind of like just an image
to indicate what was going on.

213
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.640
You're placing the four corners, so when
you have a background image, you kinda

214
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.880
need to know what areas you wanna
maintain the exact correct aspect ratio.

215
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.375
And then what part you either
wanna repeat or you wanna stretch.
