00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:05.310
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
let's talk about border radius.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.811
In the upper right-hand corner,
we have border radius is zero,

3
00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.196
which is the default.

4
00:00:10.196 --> 00:00:13.480
I've put it two different colors on it, so
that you could see where the angles are.

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.769
And when we learn how to make triangles,
or looked at making triangles yesterday

6
00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.242
with generated content, that was the power
of, we can actually use those angles.

7
00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:26.846
The thing is,
when you're doing border radius,

8
00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:30.130
you start getting kind
of funky looking stuff.

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.970
Like the border radius of 20 pixels and

10
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.690
the border radius of 50 pixels,
it's just a little bit weird.

11
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.166
So do not prefix border radius.

12
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:45.280
I see moz-border-radius in so
many different things, and

13
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.470
I think it's been supported
since Firefox 3.6.

14
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.855
Who here still supporting Firefox 3.6,
right?

15
00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:57.307
So why do I see moz-border-radius
all over the place.

16
00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.695
You also don't want to use
web kit border radius,

17
00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:06.031
because even though android 2.3 still
needs it, it slows the device down.

18
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.080
So a person's already on a crappy device
and you're making their life worse.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.830
So, don't ever prefix this, and

20
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.920
I believe like last year on the SAS
homepage, where it was showing you how to

21
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.280
use functions, it actually expanded
using anti moz-border-radius radius.

22
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.910
And I'm kind of like please.

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.686
So when you're using pre-processors or

24
00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:32.089
post-processors make sure you're
not adding when you don't need it.

25
00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:36.264
Okay, so, to make a circle you need to
have an element that has the same height

26
00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:39.910
and width,
otherwise it's going to be an ellipse.

27
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.512
But if you want to make an ellipse or a
circle, and a circle is a type of ellipse,

28
00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:45.056
just use boarder radius 50%.

29
00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:52.600
If you put two values, it's different
than putting two values with a slash.

30
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.800
So, in the third example we have
boarder-radius 10 pixels, 30 pixels.

31
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.790
Which means the upper left-hand corner and

32
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.390
the bottom right-hand corner have
a border radius of 10 pixels.

33
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.750
And the upper right-hand corner and

34
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.840
the lower left-hand corner
have a radius of 30 pixels.

35
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.060
Which is much prettier than
the thing we are doing next,

36
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.280
which is 10 pixels / 30 pixels.

37
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.617
That's basically saying horizontally
make the border radius 30 pixels and

38
00:02:28.617 --> 00:02:33.138
vertically make it 10 pixels or
the other way around.

39
00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:37.021
And than we can do really ugly stuff
cuz we can put all four values,

40
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:40.764
the bottom one that's ugly,
it's called uglification, and

41
00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:43.880
it's something we're
learning a lot about today.

42
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.960
That's how to make an ugly thing
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: on the web.

43
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.019
So that's saying basically,

44
00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.968
the upper left hand is
10 pixels by 30 pixels.

45
00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:04.769
The upper right is 35 by 35,
the bottom right is 20 by 5,

46
00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.036
and the bottom left is 15 by 5,
and that's just ugly.

47
00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:14.380
But you can do that, so just realize that
that's what boarder-radius is doing.

48
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.420
So let's just play with border-radius for
45 seconds and

49
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.510
try to make this as ugly as possible.

50
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.300
Another thing to note on this,
as you're making this ugly is,

51
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.790
you see the original corner would have
been here, and that's where this is going.

52
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.860
It's going to that mark right there,
so it's actually cutting off.

53
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.698
It's on the bottom edge,

54
00:03:36.698 --> 00:03:42.680
because your border-radius will curve in,
but your colors will stay angled.

55
00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.440
And if you just get rid of the slash
that's actually not ugly anymore.

56
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.551
The slash is in the syntax, and now
that you know it, let's see we even use

57
00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:12.579
it anywhere.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now

58
00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.481
all the examples with slashes are ugly.

59
00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:23.756
And the thing is,
if you're going to use the shorthand,

60
00:04:23.756 --> 00:04:29.495
or the longhand of a border.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There is

61
00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:35.706
a top left radius, top right, yeah.

62
00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:42.800
So, if I want to make this ugly,
I actually just do 40% or 20%.

63
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.146
Right, that's ugly, but
when I have two different values,

64
00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:50.920
a different value for
vertical than for horizontal.

65
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.936
So the vertical is 20 pixels and
the horizontal is 50%, there's no slash.

66
00:04:57.936 --> 00:04:59.636
So there's only slash in the longhand,

67
00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:04.247
not in the shorthands.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

68
00:05:04.247 --> 00:05:05.970
let's go on to border images.

69
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.066
So what is a border image?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or

70
00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:17.206
how is it supported?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Considering it's

71
00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:22.860
been around, let's just show you
how long it's been around, right?

72
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.408
Forever, oops, it's been

73
00:05:28.408 --> 00:05:34.418
around forever and it's still

74
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:41.425
prefixed.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's

75
00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:44.140
not even looking like it's going
to lose its prefix anytime soon.

76
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.660
Okay, so let me just reload this page.

77
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.790
Okay, so the border image,

78
00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:00.010
the underlying properties
are the border image source,

79
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.360
the slice, the width,
the outset, and the repeat.

80
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:11.640
And that's for the border image
is actually the shorthand, okay?

81
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.750
So unlike background image,
which is a longhand property,

82
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.200
border image is a shorthand property.

83
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.580
For it to work,
you actually have to have a border, cuz

84
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.840
you have to have that width of that border
to say how wide you want your image to be.

85
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.840
So, here I have a really ugly image.

86
00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.434
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And I am stretching it,

87
00:06:42.434 --> 00:06:46.330
and I am repeating it,
and I'm rounding it.

88
00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:59.385
And I think repeat or stretch will
look the best, okay that looks good.

89
00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:03.705
So I have a background image that
looks like a tiny version of this.

90
00:07:05.015 --> 00:07:08.305
So why would I want to use a border image?

91
00:07:08.305 --> 00:07:14.540
Because I might want to use this image
150,000 different sizes, but I always

92
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.250
want those corners to be the exact same,
and then I like it to stretch in between.

93
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.940
So, that would be a use case of not making
a 150 different sizes of this image.

94
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.820
I could also just put background cover,
right?

95
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.470
But if I take it and I make a background
cover, and I have something that's

96
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.380
500 pixels wide, those corners on the edge
are gonna stretch, and I don't want that.

97
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.130
So that will be a used case for
border image.

98
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.050
So here I'm stretching it, cuz it's
a gradient and I want to look tall.

99
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.930
If I repeated it In the middle
I'm repeating that gradient and

100
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.600
that doesn't look good.

101
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.908
If I was doing a stamp,
like if I had a picture of a stamp,

102
00:07:59.908 --> 00:08:03.196
all I would have to do is one
repetition of that stamp, and

103
00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:06.644
then I could actually make
that stamp repeat 100 times.

104
00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:10.724
Cuz you know how stamps go, they have a
straight edge, or they used to before they

105
00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:14.400
were stickers, now I think they're
just rectangular, I'm not sure.

106
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.040
I don't even know the last time I used
a stamp was because I don't know the last

107
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.650
time I paid a bill.

108
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:24.933
No I pay all of my bills online so
I'm very happy to have my bank pay for

109
00:08:24.933 --> 00:08:30.699
the stamps, because they certainly
don't give me interest on my money.

110
00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:33.148
Okay so, I have these properties.

111
00:08:33.148 --> 00:08:37.430
Basically, the border-image-source is the
first one I declare which is the gradient

112
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.330
image that I used.

113
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.790
The border-image-slice is
up to four values, and

114
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.820
I'm gonna show you in the next picture
a little bit better how it's explained.

115
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.573
And then I have border-image-width, which
is going to be basically the same size as

116
00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:57.871
the width of my border.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

117
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.474
then I repeat it,
round it or stretch it, and

118
00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:05.219
I can't remember what the outset is cuz I
didn't use it, I don't think I need it.

119
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:15.660
Yeah, I didn't use it, okay so
here we have a very long cat.

120
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.870
Right there is basically
what the border is,

121
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.429
you see the border width
is 48 by 137 by 68 by 84.

122
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.610
And in my border image I repeat that as
48, 137, 68, 84, without the pixel units.

123
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.815
Then I can use the property of
fill to fill it or not fill it,

124
00:09:39.815 --> 00:09:42.218
and my cat looks better filled.

125
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.618
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then I stretch it,

126
00:09:51.618 --> 00:09:56.872
because if I repeat
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It

127
00:09:56.872 --> 00:10:03.340
looks really weird,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So I stretch it.

128
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.600
So, what I would like you to do is just
take two minutes to change the border

129
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.110
sizes, to play with basically
both of these screens.

130
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.120
So you have a little bit
of an understanding,

131
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.640
this is actually the produced
syntax right here.

132
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.537
So you can switch these
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

133
00:10:23.537 --> 00:10:27.010
the URL is gradient, so
let's see if I can find.

134
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.719
While you do that,
I'm gonna find the URL of this image.

135
00:10:42.173 --> 00:10:42.953
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you see I used

136
00:10:42.953 --> 00:10:46.570
the style here, right here, and
I told you yesterday to not use style.

137
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.240
The reason I'm doing that is because
I'm actually doing sliders and

138
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.130
I'm dynamically reloading the page, so
it's my Java script that's doing it.

139
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.100
I would not do this in production, but

140
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.910
this is an example as to
show you how to do this.

141
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.880
There's so much bad and evil code,
I'd say it's embarrassing,

142
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.200
but I don't get embarrassed.

143
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.920
So this is the original image
that we stretched, okay?

144
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.940
So that's what you're stretching.

145
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.492
What you wanna do is you wanna
repeat this inner part, but

146
00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:20.047
you wanna maintain these
little corners on the outside.

147
00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:22.807
So how

148
00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:28.187
big
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: does

149
00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.560
your gradient have to be.

150
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.577
So let's actually go over here, oops, and

151
00:11:33.577 --> 00:11:39.658
change this from longcat,
if you want to, you don't have to, and

152
00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:44.690
do that.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

153
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:49.511
now I just have the four corners,
except for

154
00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:54.592
I really wanna have about 10px, by 10px,

155
00:11:54.592 --> 00:11:59.046
by 10px, by 10px, is that enough?

156
00:11:59.046 --> 00:12:01.932
Yeah, and then my old syntax,

157
00:12:01.932 --> 00:12:07.376
cuz I have to look at things,
cuz I don't know this by heart

158
00:12:11.701 --> 00:12:15.861
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Is, no,

159
00:12:15.861 --> 00:12:19.607
stretch.

160
00:12:29.601 --> 00:12:30.240
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And, okay, so

161
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.630
let's just copy this over here.

162
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.245
I'm going to hit return right here,

163
00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:44.610
cuz you can actually have things that
are two lines long, and just do this.

164
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.510
So why does it not have
the stuff in the middle?

165
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:55.133
Because I need to fill it.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

166
00:12:55.133 --> 00:12:56.100
where do I put the fill?

167
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.055
I don't remember.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: After the image URL.

168
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.367
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There we go, and

169
00:13:15.367 --> 00:13:21.488
let me do a 30.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 30,

170
00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:26.542
I hope you're playing along, cuz I don't
have to come all the way to Minnesota

171
00:13:26.542 --> 00:13:34.820
to play with this, I can do this at home.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, and width,

172
00:13:38.654 --> 00:13:43.977
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 60 pixels, height,

173
00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:52.330
80 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Box sizing,

174
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.230
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

175
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:08.284
now it's 60 pixels by 80 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Why

176
00:14:08.284 --> 00:14:14.277
don't we make the width 160, 40,

177
00:14:14.277 --> 00:14:20.813
and then just do 20, 20, 20, 20?

178
00:14:20.813 --> 00:14:24.075
So you see how I can make that image and
no matter what size I make it,

179
00:14:24.075 --> 00:14:25.210
it still looks ugly?

180
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.290
I mean, no matter what size I make it,

181
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.530
it still looks like it was
the original image of the button?

182
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.450
It doesn't look like I completely played
around with that and stretched it.

183
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.960
So that's border image,
one last thing I want to cover

184
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.350
on border image which I didn't covered
before is how the border image is placed.

185
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:50.260
Basically, when you are just
defining the widths of the borders

186
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.940
you're defining what was on the left, what
was on the top, what was on the right, and

187
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.740
what was on the bottom.

188
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.564
And then you're replacing, or slicing,

189
00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:02.257
the background, that border image,
into nine parts.

190
00:15:02.257 --> 00:15:06.203
The upper right-hand part was put
in the upper right-hand corner,

191
00:15:06.203 --> 00:15:10.490
the upper left-hand part was put
in the upper left-hand corner.

192
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.821
The bottom right-hand part was put
in the bottom right-hand corner, and

193
00:15:12.821 --> 00:15:15.390
the bottom left-hand part was put
in the bottom left-hand corner.

194
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.990
And then the rest of it was stretched or
repeated.

195
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.740
So this is kind of like just an image
to indicate what was going on,

196
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.960
you're placing the four corners.

197
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.939
So when you have a background image,
you kind of need to know what areas you

198
00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:31.648
want to maintain the exact
correct aspect ratio.

199
00:15:31.648 --> 00:15:34.940
And then what part you either want
to repeat or you want to stretch.
