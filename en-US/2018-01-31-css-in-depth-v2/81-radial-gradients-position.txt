>> Estelle Weyl: Radial gradients have two things in common with the linear gradients which are color stops and color hints.
>> Estelle Weyl: The thing to remember in terms of the position is you wanna use the at keyword. The position that you're declaring is the center point of your radial gradient, the center of the circle or the ellipse.

[00:00:26]

>> Estelle Weyl: And if the size specifies as a circle or if it's omitted, the length can be a length or percent. So let's look here at this. This is the default. By default, a background gradient that is radial, just like linear, will be at the center. It'll be centered.

[00:00:49]
Here we're saying an ellipse at center. Default is ellipse, default is at center. And then I say palegoldenrod at 0% and rebeccapurple at 100%.
>> Estelle Weyl: If I said at 25, 25,
>> Estelle Weyl: Or at 5.
>> Estelle Weyl: One of the other things is that it basically has the same aspect ratio as the parent.

[00:01:26]
So the aspect ratio of my gradient is basically in this corner right here, and if I actually do 0, 0, the palegoldenrod, it will be right here, it's palegoldenrod. Right here at the farthest corner, it's rebeccapurple. And the gradient line basically goes like that.
>> Estelle Weyl: So in terms of position, you can use the same values as the background position property that we used earlier today.

[00:01:59]

>> Estelle Weyl: You wanna include the at key term in front of it though. With background position on background images we don't include the M, right? But in the radial gradient, when you're declaring a radial gradient, you can also add a background position to the radial gradient and say I want this radial gradient background image to be here.

[00:02:17]
But within the synax of the radial gradient, you're using the at key term.
>> Estelle Weyl: There are no angles. Because it's a circle, right? So it's going around or it's an ellipse, so it's going around. So it's called a gradient ray, not a gradient line. So let's talk about the position.

[00:02:37]
This little black dot, see how it says black 1%, 1%? So it's gonna go black from 0 to 1% in the midpoint there. It's a solid black circle wherever the midpoint is of my gradient, that's where it's gonna be. So play along with this. If I move it to the 25% mark, it's 25% from the left and 95% from the top.

[00:03:00]
And here we change it to 15%, it's up near the top. And you can see that that gradient changed, right? There's definitely more purple and the yellow's in here in the center. So the position is within the background image size that you have, so if we actually said background-size: 300px 400px, right?

[00:03:30]
Background.
>> Estelle Weyl: Actually let's make it 400 by 300 cuz this looks ugly.
>> Estelle Weyl: And I know I wanna make things look ugly but not that ugly. Background-repeat.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so I'm just gonna have this single one and then I'm just gonna add background position and put it in the bottom-right so we can look at it.

[00:04:02]
Background-position: 100% 100%, and I spelled it wrong. Okay, so there's my gradient in the bottom corner. It's a background image that is 400 by 300 pixels, right? It's 400 pixels wide, 300 pixels tall. If we remember from the background position property, the bottom right-hand corner of the background image is in the bottom right-hand corner of the parent.

[00:04:36]
That's just background position. But in terms of the ellipse itself, the center of the ellipse is 25% from the left and 15% from the top of that background image size. Whatever that size was, right? We could make it 500 and 400.
>> Estelle Weyl: It's going to move to be within that but I wanna put it down here so we can actually see it.

[00:05:04]

>> Estelle Weyl: I could do circle.
>> Estelle Weyl: And you can barely see a change but if I did a background size 600. Now let's do 800. All right? Circle. Ellipse. Do you see the difference? This one's really long and not that tall. Okay. And let's do it at the 50% mark from the top and then change it to circle.

[00:05:39]
So here you could see that that ellipse is a really long ellipse, right? If I just circle, see it's rounder. It's not going all the way off to the right. It is actually going off all the way to the right, this is where the 100% mark is. Okay.

[00:05:55]
So we kind of did position already. You can actually use the four point background position. Remember when we were talking about the 4 when you can say 15 pixels bottom or right 10 pixels bottom 10 pixels? So with gradients, you can actually use that four point background position.

[00:06:20]
Who here had background position with four points being new today? Was that new for people? Okay, who here knew it?
>> Estelle Weyl: Who here didn't know it? Okay. [LAUGH] So yeah, it can be used not just in background position but in actual position of your gradient.
