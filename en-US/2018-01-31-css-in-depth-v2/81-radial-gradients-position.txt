>> Estelle Weyl: Radial gradients have two things in common with the linear gradients, which are color stops and color hints.
>> Estelle Weyl: The thing to remember in terms of the position, is you wanna use the at, keyword. The position that you're declaring is the center-point of your radial gradient, it's the center of the circle or the ellipse.

[00:00:27]

>> Estelle Weyl: And if the size specifies as a circle or if it's omitted, the length can be a length or percent, so let's look here at this. This is the default, by default, a background gradient that is radial just like linear will be at the center, it'll be centered.

[00:00:49]
Here we're saying an elipse at center, default is a lipse, default is at center. And then I say pale golden rod at 0%, and rebeccapurple at 100%. If I said at 50,50, at 25, 25, rather,
>> Estelle Weyl: Or aa 5.
>> Estelle Weyl: One of the other things is that it basically has the same aspect ratio as the parent.

[00:01:26]
So the aspect ratio of my gradient is basically in this corner right here. If I actually do 0, 0, the pale goldenrod it would be right here, it's pale goldenrod. Right here at the farthest corner it's rebeccapurple and the gradient line basically goes like that. In terms of position, you can use the same values as the background position property that we used earlier today.

[00:01:58]
You wanna include the at key term in front of it though, with background position we don't include the end, right. But when you're declaring the radio gradient, you can also add a background position to radio gradient and say, I want this radio gradient background name to be here.

[00:02:16]
But within the same text of the radio gradient, you're using the at key term.
>> Estelle Weyl: There are no angles because it's a circle, right. So it's going around, or it's a ellipse that's going around. So it's called a gradient ray not a gradient line. So let's talk about the position.

[00:02:36]
This little black dot, you see how it says black 1% 1% so it's gonna go black from 0 to 1%. And the midpoint,
>> Estelle Weyl: There, it's a solid black circle. Wherever the midpoint is of my gradient that's where it's gonna be. So play along with this, if I move it to the 25% mark, i t's 25% from the left and 95% from the top.

[00:02:59]
And here we've changed it to 15%, it's up near the top and you can see that that gradient changed, right. There's definitely more purple and the yellow' here in the center. So the position is within the background image size that you have. So if we actually said, background-size: 300px by 400px; all right, background,

[00:03:38]

>> Estelle Weyl: Actually, let me just make it 400 by 300, cuz this looks ugly. And I know I wanna make things look ugly, but not that ugly, background-repeat.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so I'm just gonna have a single one. And then I'm just gonna add background position and put it in the bottom right so we can look at it, background position, 100%, 100%.

[00:04:11]
And I spelled it wrong, okay. So this migrating on the bottom corner, it's a four, it's a background image that is 400 by 300 pixels, right, it's 400 pixels wide, 300 pixels tall. If you remember from the background position property, the bottom line right hand corner of the background image in the back right corner of the parent, thatâ€™s just background position.

[00:04:38]
But, in terms of the ellipse itself the center of the ellipse is 25% from the left and 15% from the top of that background image size, whatever that size was, right. We can make it 500 and 400, it's going to move to be within that, but I wanna put it down here so we can actually see it.

[00:05:03]
I could do circle and you can barely see a change. But if I did a background size, this 600, let us do 100, all right circle ellipse. Do you see the difference, this went really long and not that tall, okay. And let's do it at the 50% mark from the top and then change it to circle.

[00:05:39]
So here you can see that that ellipse is a really long ellipse, right. If I do circle, see, it's rounder, it's not going all the way off to the right. I mean, it is actually going off all the way to the right, like this is where the 100% is.

[00:05:55]
Okay, so we kinda did position already. You can actually use the four point background position. Remember when we were talking about the four, when you could say 15 pixels bottom or right, 10 pixels, bottom, 10 pixels. So you can, with gradients, you can actually use that four point background position.

[00:06:20]
Who here had background position with four points being new today? Was that new for people? Okay, who here knew it? Who here didn't know it? Okay [LAUGH]. So yeah, it can be used not just in background position, but in actual deposition of your gradient.
