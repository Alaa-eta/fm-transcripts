>> Estelle Weyl: So, here, I have a more complicated grid. And it says grid-template-columns, repeat twice 2frs, then repeat three times 1fr. So column 3, 4, and 5, are half the width of 1 and 2, and column 6 is 3frs.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then grid template row, the first one is 2frs, then the second one is 125, these are both 4Ms, and these are not declared.

[00:00:38]
So why is row number 1 so tiny? Anyone have a guess?
>> Estelle Weyl: I had no free space. Fr is basically 0. These last lines aren't actually declared. I could have actually said 6fr.
>> Estelle Weyl: So you have 2fr, 125, 4m, 4m, and 6fr. So my fr was basically tiny, it was a few pixels.

[00:01:20]

>> Estelle Weyl: It's the free space that's right there.
>> Estelle Weyl: So like 2 pixels.
>> Estelle Weyl: Lets make it 5, 4, 3. Doesn't look very good when I do that so I should make it- Okay. Okay so fr, the term is actually fraction unit and it describes a fraction of the available space.

[00:01:49]
So that's that extra space within the height in that case or the width that can be divided equally based on how much space is available. And then the repeat, I think you've have a good understanding of what to repeat is. So, let's go back here, and I'm gonna give you two minutes to just play with it and write your own widths and heights.

[00:02:27]

>> Estelle Weyl: Keep playing with it but grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, that's one of those things that you're never gonna remember how to write that. But at least now you know what it is so you can look it up. I still look it up every single time.
>> Estelle Weyl: That's why I kept copying and pasting it, because what's that damn word?

[00:03:03]

>> Estelle Weyl: The other thing that's really important is the fact that you can mix the units. So if you want your aside to be 200 pixels, and you're nav on the other side to to be 200 pixels, and the thing in the middle to be whatever size it needs to be, you can say a min of something and 1fr.

[00:03:27]
So basically take all the free space but at least something wide.
>> Estelle Weyl: So here, I actually added, we're gonna cover this in a second, I added the min and max for the last column.
>> Estelle Weyl: And here what I did is I made it wider than the window. I basically said I want the first two to be 200 pixels, this next three to be 150 pixels, and that just didn't fit on the screen.

[00:05:25]
And then the last one, either to be a minimum or maximum of 10 pixels, so it's gonna be a minimum of 10 pixels. But I could say a minimum of 100 pixels, and a maximum of 1fr. And if I don't have any fr units, fr is 0. It's gonna make it 100 pixels.

[00:05:44]
Okay, so let's continue. So as you saw, we've been using some different units for those widths. Generally, we use the fr unit, and a length or percentage, but you can say max-content, which is in flex box and in grid, and everything. Your element has content in it. Right now we just have the number 1, so max content and main content it's just tiny.

[00:06:15]
But it can be relative content or it can be minmax which is a size between the min. If max is less than min, then max is ignored, and minmax is treated as min. Or it can be auto, and let's go and add auto, or it can be fit content which is basically a calculation of the content, the length, or the percentage.

[00:06:41]
So if we just do here auto,
>> Estelle Weyl: I meant to put it here, that's why it didn't work. It basically says I only need to be the size of the text. But if I do first-child, it's shorter. And I do before
>> Estelle Weyl: Content.
>> Estelle Weyl: Auto became much bigger, right?

[00:07:34]
Because I have content in there.
