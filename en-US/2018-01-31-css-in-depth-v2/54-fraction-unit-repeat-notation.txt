>> Estelle Weyl: So here, I have a more complicated grid. And it says grid-template-columns repeat twice, 2frs, then repeat three times, 1fr. So column 3, 4 and 5 are half the width of 1 and 2, and column 6 is three frs.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then grid template row,
>> Estelle Weyl: The first one is 2frs, then the second one is 125, these are both 4ms, and these are not declared.

[00:00:39]
So why is row number 1 so tiny, anyone have a guess?
>> Estelle Weyl: I have no free space, so fr is basically zero. I could have made these last lines aren't actually declared. I could have actually said 6fr.
>> Estelle Weyl: So you have 2fr, 125, 4em and 6 fr. So my fr was basically tiny little few pixels.

[00:01:20]

>> Estelle Weyl: It's in a free space that's right there.
>> Estelle Weyl: So like two pixels.
>> Estelle Weyl: So make it 5,
>> Estelle Weyl: 4,
>> Estelle Weyl: 3, it doesn't look very good when I do that, so I should make it; okay. Okay so, fr is the term is actually fraction unit, and it describes a fraction of the available space.

[00:01:49]
So that's that extra space within the height, in that case, or the width, that can be divided equally based on how much space is available. And then the repeat, I think you have a good understanding of what the repeat is. So let's go back here and I'm gonna give you two minutes to just play with it and write your own widths and heighths.

[00:02:16]

>> Estelle Weyl: And you can,
>> Estelle Weyl: Yeah.
>> Estelle Weyl: So the thing is, keep playing with it, but grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, that's one of those things that you're never gonna remember how to write that. But at least now you know what it is so you can look it up, I still look it up every single time.

[00:02:47]

>> Estelle Weyl: That's why I kept copying and pasting it cuz I'm kinda like.
>> Estelle Weyl: The other thing that's really important is the fact that you can mix the units. So if you want your aside to be 200 pixels, and your nav on the other side to be 200 pixels, and the thing in the middle to be whatever size it needs to be?

[00:03:21]
You can set a min of something, and 1fr. So basically, taking the all the free space, but at least something wide.
>> Estelle Weyl: So here I actually added we're gonna cover this in a second, I added the min and max for the last column.
>> Estelle Weyl: And here, what I did is I made it wider than the window.

[00:05:15]
I basically said, I want the first two to be 200 pixels this next three to be 150 pixels, and that just didn't fit on the screen. And then the last one, either to be a minimum or maximum of ten pixels, so it's gonna be a minimum of ten pixels.

[00:05:32]
But I could say minimum of 100 pixels and a maximum of 1fr, and if I don't have any fr units, fr is 0, it's gonna make it 100 pixels, okay. So, let's continue, so, as you saw we've been using some different units for those widths. Generally we use the fr unit and the length of percentage, but you can say max content, which is, In Flexbox and in GRID, and in everything, your element has content in it.

[00:06:07]
Right now we just have the number one, so max content and min content is just tiny. But it can be relative to the content, or it can be min, max, which is the size between the min. If max is less than min then max is ignored and min max is treated as min.

[00:06:30]
Or it could be auto, and let's go and add auto, or it could be fit content, which is basically a calculation of the content, the length, or the percentage. So, if we just do here, auto,
>> Estelle Weyl: I meant to put it here, that is why it didn't work.

[00:07:00]
It's basically says I'm gonna need to be the size of the text.
>> Estelle Weyl: But if I do, li first of type or I can just first child shorter, and I do before.
>> Estelle Weyl: Content.
>> Estelle Weyl: Auto became much bigger, right, because I have content in there.
