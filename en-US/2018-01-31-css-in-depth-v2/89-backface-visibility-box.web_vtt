00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:08.261
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: When we did,
still, yes, mastery,

2
00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:13.235
and we had the snowflakes coming down.

3
00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:17.300
The reason that they're going left and
right and

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.430
floating is because the transform origin
is actually outside of their center.

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.650
So they're being translated
from top to bottom,

6
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.140
but they're spinning, and they're spinning
around a point that is not in the center.

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.310
So they're basically spinning around,
going like this, but

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.370
since they're going down,
they're actually going like that.

9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.049
So all of them are doing this, but

10
00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:42.228
you can't really see that it's doing that,
cuz it's so slow.

11
00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:44.091
Kind of cool?

12
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:46.350
So that was the magic of transform-origin.

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.319
So the keyword positions are left,
right, bottom, top, and center.

14
00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.830
You can use any length, value,
or any percentage value.

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.539
The default is the center at 50-50%.

16
00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.255
And that should get rid of prefix.

17
00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:01.930
It's basically supported,

18
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.822
any browser that supports transform
supports transform-origin.

19
00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:09.402
And you don't need to prefix it,
because prefixing is no longer necessary.

20
00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:16.222
Then we have transform-style and
that is for 3D features.

21
00:01:16.222 --> 00:01:19.507
If you have a 3D element on
top of another 3D element,

22
00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:24.840
it's basically do you want to preserve
3D or do you want to make it flat.

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.242
It's how to handle nascent elements
that also rendered in a 3D space.

24
00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:35.052
Oddly, there's a few properties
where it won't work that you have to

25
00:01:35.052 --> 00:01:37.100
have it at the default value.

26
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.802
So if you've declared overflow,
clip, clip-path, filter,

27
00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:46.932
mask-border-source, mask-image,
or mix-blend-mode, which

28
00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:52.841
they are all properties that we haven't
covered yet, see why this book is so big?

29
00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:56.422
Then it doesn't actually do anything.

30
00:01:56.422 --> 00:02:04.043
It's set on the parent and I tried making
it appear like what it would look like.

31
00:02:04.043 --> 00:02:09.206
So basically, the parent is
translated in the 3D space and

32
00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:13.550
so, is the child, and
the child is coming at you.

33
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.863
If it was actually flat, it would not.

34
00:02:20.863 --> 00:02:24.885
Let's just skip this one,
okay, backface-visibility.

35
00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:29.183
I was talking about RGP, when you flip it,
you don't want to see it,

36
00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:32.831
the backwards,
cuz you don't want to see it upside down.

37
00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:40.120
So basically, here,
both of these have translated 180 degrees.

38
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.340
And one you can see, and
the other you can't.

39
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.110
So here,
there actually is generated content.

40
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.270
If I do 0, you can see both of them.

41
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.439
If I do 90, you can see neither of them.

42
00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.260
If I do 85 degrees,
you can see both of them, but barely.

43
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.010
But if I do 105, one of them,

44
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.380
you can't see it all,
because I did backface-visibility hidden.

45
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.426
But the first one I did
backface-visibility visible and

46
00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:11.550
if you can you can't actually read RSVP.

47
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.108
So let's actually do it completely upside

48
00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:20.930
down.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right?

49
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.510
They're both translated in the exact same
way or rotated in the exact same way.

50
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.563
One is backwards, and

51
00:03:27.563 --> 00:03:32.981
I'm saying you can't look at it now.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

52
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:35.781
let me just see if, okay, it didn't show.

53
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:40.114
So when you'll see playing cards or
something like that online,

54
00:03:40.114 --> 00:03:44.080
you'll have a playing card here and
this is the face.

55
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.300
And this is the back of the card.

56
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.560
And so you rotate both, and you think it's
doing this, but really, you can't do this.

57
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.730
They're both doing that,
they're both rotating.

58
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.045
But when it hits this mark,
you want this one to be seen and

59
00:03:58.045 --> 00:03:59.852
you don't want this one
to be seen anymore.

60
00:03:59.852 --> 00:04:06.382
You don't want the one in front
to show the back of the RSVP.

61
00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:10.761
You wanna show the back of the card,
you don't wanna show the ace.

62
00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:14.650
They're all basically the same,
okay, the King.

63
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.270
You don't want the K to be backwards.

64
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.080
Like if you had a King and
you rotated it like this and

65
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.198
you saw the card still,
the k would be backwards.

66
00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:28.080
So you wanna make it look like the face
of the card is going behind here and

67
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.744
you do that by saying you
can do it one of two ways.

68
00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:33.992
You can actually change the index or

69
00:04:33.992 --> 00:04:38.980
you can just stay back with
face invisibility hidden.

70
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.570
This isn't supported ED or
it's just starting to be.

71
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.226
It's in Firefox,
it's in Chrome 64, and Opera 51.

72
00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:51.686
So it's something I haven't played with
yet, but its basically the viewBox, so

73
00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:52.950
the transform box property.

74
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.460
So in the future, this will be a property.

75
00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.098
I'm,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: In the future,

76
00:05:01.098 --> 00:05:04.142
transform-box property will
have a value of border-box,

77
00:05:04.142 --> 00:05:06.750
which means that the border
is the box reference.

78
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.880
It will have fill-box, which will
the bounding box as a reference box.

79
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.844
And then viewBox Which is current in SVG.

80
00:05:13.844 --> 00:05:17.864
It's kind of like the viewBox on SVG,
but it's not yet supported.

81
00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:20.154
So I can't really explain it yet,
because I don't really know it.
