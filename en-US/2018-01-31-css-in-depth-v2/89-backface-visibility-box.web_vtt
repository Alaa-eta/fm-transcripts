00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:11.427
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: When we did,
estelleweyl.cssmastery.

2
00:00:11.427 --> 00:00:16.059
And we had the snowflakes coming down,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The reasons that

3
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.509
they're going left and right and

4
00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.430
floating is because the transform origin
is actually outside of their center.

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.320
So they're being translated
from top to bottom but

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.140
they're spinning and they're spinning
around a point that is not in the center.

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.180
So they're basically spinning
around going like this.

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.376
But since they're going down,
they're actually going like that.

9
00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:35.944
So [INAUDIBLE] doing this but

10
00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:39.500
you can't really see that it's
doing that cuz it's so slow.

11
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.740
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Kinda cool?

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.350
Okay, so
that was the magic of transform-origin.

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.710
So the keyword positions are left,
right, bottom, top, and center.

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.535
You can use any length value or
any percentage value,

15
00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:56.854
the default is the center, at 50% 50%.

16
00:00:56.854 --> 00:01:00.063
And I should get rid of prefix.

17
00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:02.079
It's basically supported,

18
00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.918
any browser that supports transforms
supports transform-origin and

19
00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:11.766
you don't need to prefix it because
prefixing is no longer necessary.

20
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:16.330
And we have transform-style and
that is for 3D features.

21
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.100
If you have a 3D element on
top of another 3D element,

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.840
it's basically do you wanna preseve 3D or
do you wanna make it flat.

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.484
It's how to handle nestled elements
that are also rendered in a 3D space.

24
00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:34.702
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Oddly, there's a few
properties where it won't work that you

25
00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:37.100
have to have it at the default value.

26
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.828
So if you've declared overflow,
clip, clip-path, filter,

27
00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:44.424
mask-border-source, mask-image or
mix-blend-mode,

28
00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:47.630
which are all properties
that we haven't covered yet.

29
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.490
See why this book is so big?

30
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.115
Then it doesn't actually do anything.

31
00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:03.753
It's set on the parent and I tried making
it appear like what it would look like.

32
00:02:03.753 --> 00:02:10.645
So basically the parent is translated
in the 3D space and so is the child.

33
00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:14.504
And so is the child, and
the child is kind of coming at you.

34
00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:16.493
If it was actually flat, it would not.

35
00:02:19.407 --> 00:02:22.290
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's just skip this one.

36
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.970
Okay, backface-visibility.

37
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.430
I was talking about RSVP,
when you flip it,

38
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.314
you don't want to see it, the backwards
cuz you don't wanna see it upside down.

39
00:02:31.314 --> 00:02:37.610
So basically here both

40
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.340
of these have translated 180 degrees and
one you can see and the other you can't.

41
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.110
So here there actually
is generated content.

42
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.160
If I do 0, you can see both of them.

43
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.920
If I do 90, you can see neither of them.

44
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.260
If I do 85 degrees,
you can see both of them but barely.

45
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.310
But if I do 105, one of them you can't see

46
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.380
at all because I did
backface-visibility: hidden.

47
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.990
But the first one,

48
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.550
I did backface-visibility: visible, and if
you can see, you can't actually read RSVP.

49
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.544
So let's acutally do it
completely upside down.

50
00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:20.716
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right?

51
00:03:20.716 --> 00:03:25.510
They're both translated in the exact same
way or rotated in the exact same way.

52
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.022
One is backwards and
I'm saying you can't look at it now.

53
00:03:32.582 --> 00:03:35.373
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And let me just see if,
okay, it didn't show.

54
00:03:35.373 --> 00:03:40.555
So when you'll see playing cards or
something like that online, you'll

55
00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:45.836
have a playing card here and this is
the face and this is the back of the card.

56
00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:48.933
And so you rotate both and
you think it's doing this but

57
00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:53.522
really you can't do this, they're both
doing that, they're both rotating.

58
00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:56.941
But when it hits this mark,
you want this one to be seen and

59
00:03:56.941 --> 00:03:59.880
you don't want this one
to be seen anymore.

60
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.195
You don't want the one in front to show
the backwards the back of the RSVP.

61
00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:09.540
You wanna show the back of the card,
you don't wanna show the ace.

62
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.800
They're all really three,
they're all basically the same.

63
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.430
Okay, the king,
you don't want the K to be backwards.

64
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.080
If you had a king and
you rotated it like this and

65
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.190
you saw the card still,
the K would be backwards.

66
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.044
So you wanna make it look like the face
of the card is going behind here and

67
00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:30.823
you do that by saying,
you can do it one of two ways.

68
00:04:30.823 --> 00:04:36.925
You can actually change the Z index or you
can just say backface-visibility: hidden.

69
00:04:39.744 --> 00:04:44.411
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This isn't supported yet
or it's just starting to be.

70
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.247
It's in Firefox.

71
00:04:45.247 --> 00:04:47.505
It's in Chrome 64 and Opera 51.

72
00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:50.391
So something I haven't played with yet but

73
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:54.970
it's basically the view-box,
so the transform-box property.

74
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.208
So in the future, this will be a property.

75
00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:02.471
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And the future
transform-box property will have a value

76
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:06.767
of border-box which means that
the border is the box reference.

77
00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:11.533
And will have fill-box which will be
the bounding box as a reference box, and

78
00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:16.610
then view-box which is currently in SVG,
it's kinda like the view-box of SVG.

79
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.758
But it's not yet supported, so
I can't really explain it yet

80
00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:24.534
because I don't really know it.
