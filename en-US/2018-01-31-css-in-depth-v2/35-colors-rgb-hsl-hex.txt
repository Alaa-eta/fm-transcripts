[00:00:01]
>> Estelle Weyl: So colors, all these colors have the exact same value. They're all white. So you can declare it white. You can have a three digits hexadecimal value. A six digit hexadecimal value and you can also have an eight digit hexadecimal value. This might be new to some people but the six characters are basically the white from above, and the last two f's means a 100% opaque.

[00:00:28]
So we now have eight digit hexadecimal values that will last two being, it's what rgba, it's basically what it is. Then we have rgb which red, green, or blue and you can either use 0 to 255, or you can use percents from 0 to 100. You cannot combine the two, that is incorrect.

[00:00:49]
You can't put percents on some and 0 to 255 on the other. So then we have RGBA, which is the same thing but with the last value being the opacity. In this case, we're trying to get to 1, so it's a 100% opaque or 1. Then we have HSL and HSLA, which is hue, saturation, and lightness.

[00:01:10]
Which if you use Photoshop, is similar to hue, saturation, and brightness, I think. Yeah, HSB, and we have HSLA, which is the same thing but with a alpha transparent at the end. And then we have two other things, which is this key term of transparent and the key term of current color.

[00:01:32]
Current color is the current color of the text. So let's go first to the white, which is the name key terms. We've got a bunch of them in CSS 2 and CSS 3, or in CSS 2. The only one that was added since then was Rebecca Purple. So the co author of this book, Eric Myer, his daughter passed away on her sixth birthday and because he's the Oprah of CSS.

[00:02:04]
And his daughter's name was Rebecca and her favorite color was purple. In his honor, they actually, it was a color that was not yet used. So I believe it's 536, it's one of my favorite colors actually, it's 639 rather. So that's the only one that's been added since the original.

[00:02:27]
Then we have currentColor and currentColor is a special color and it's no matter what color and it uses the default for a lot of things. So like if you do border and you do 3 or 4 solid 3 pixels or just border solid. When you do a border, we'll cover that later, but borders you have to declare what type of border it is and that's all you have to declare.

[00:02:49]
The other 2 values are default. They default to medium which is 3 pixels wide in most browsers and they default to current color to the color, which is the color of the text.
>> Estelle Weyl: There's other name colors, such as current color, which have become deprecated. So these will work in a lot of browsers, and they're just here for legacy reasons.

[00:03:13]
Just to remind you if you actually hit this was valid at one point.
>> Estelle Weyl: Then we have RGB and RGBA. So all colors, well that's not true. All colors used to be RGB, whether it was hexadecimal notation or RGB notation. Now we have HSL which is different and we also had CMKY, which is cyan-magenta, which is for print.

[00:03:39]
I don't know if that still exists or not. So our RG, when we have hexadecimal notation, the first two digits are the red, the second two digits are the green, the third two digits are the blue. Similarly when we have RGB, it stands for red, green, blue and that's what the R, G and the B stand for.

[00:04:01]
As I said earlier, you can have it with numbers, from 0 to 255. With 0 being black or complete lack of color and 255 being complete saturation of color. Or you can do percents, which 0 being a complete lack of color and 100% being complete saturation, and then we can also add an alpha transparency if we add the a at the end.

[00:04:25]
So in this case, I use percents on the latter one, and 0 through 255 on the prior one, again, you can't mix those up. And what I could have done there as well is put 40 bfac, like cc or something like that. No, 66, probably, for 0.2, I don't know what 0.2 actually is, but I could've put those 8 digit colors, but we'll cover that in a second.

[00:04:57]
Then we have HSLA colors, which are hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha transparency. So the hues go from zero, which is red, through to orange, through to yellow. I passed yellow. Yellow's in there somewhere, yeah. Through to green and blue and purple and back to red. So, this right here, that thing right there, is actually 360 separate spams with each color in there that's how I did that.

[00:05:35]
I could have just used a gradient but why make things easy when I can put 360 [INAUDIBLE] in there. Saturation, 100% saturation means full of color and 0% saturation always gonna be a gray cuz it means the color is completely not saturated. Generally you want to go with a hundred there, and lightness, 100% percent is always going to be white.

[00:06:02]
0 is always going to be black, 50% percent is the midpoint of super bright color. Then, alpha transparency you have fully opaque and somewhat transparent. And the reason that you can still see HSLA Colors right there is because I have text shadow on there. So I have a color that is alpha transparent, but the text shadow is not.

[00:06:35]
So, box shadows, or actually just shadows on the outside or on the inside of an element. Whereas text shadow is actually behind the whole text, it's a copy of the whole text in the shadow form and can move it, but it's actually shadow of the whole text.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, then I have this little converter that I reprogrammed it for this talk and I hope that it works cause it worked a month ago when I reprogrammed it.

[00:07:04]
It takes a long time to make 702 slides. So here, if I change the alpha transparency. I can actually figure out what 0.2 is. 0.2 is 33. Remember when I was trying to figure it out? So here is my color converter. I have a GitHub repo. You can use it.

[00:07:26]
It's open-source. It basically allows you to pick any color you want and any alpha transparency you want, but do you need this? Let me show a cool feature. Let me go to alpha transparency there. Okay, I'm gonna go and check my inspector. I'm gonna go look at the div here, and it says the background color is RGB 245, 148, 148.

[00:07:56]
That's what it says, right? Okay cool we got it right but if I open this up, it gives me the information here, and I can actually convert it to HAOA and hexadecimal right there. So you actually have a full color picker in your developer tools. Which is how I pick the hideous colors on the back of this slide deck.

[00:08:23]
So I would pick a color, open it up, and then pick another color that I thought was [INAUDIBLE]. Clashes just enough to make it hideous, and then that's how I pick the colors. So let's get out of here, okay. Another feature in here [NOISE] is,
>> Estelle Weyl: Yeah you see I use Rebecca purple a lot.

[00:08:49]
This is Rebecca purple and royal blue deck and if I click on this text right here, and,
>> Estelle Weyl: I go down to color.
>> Estelle Weyl: Anyone seen color?
>> Estelle Weyl: Color, if I open this up here, you see that white line right there? That in an accessibility feature. If I want to make sure that I have enough contrast.

[00:09:22]
Which currently my contrast is at 11.9, which is serious contrast, but if I pick this color here, it'll say low contrast. So there's actually if you want to make sure that your site is accessible, there's accessibility features, but there's an actually separate accessibility features. But within this right here, if you're going to pick a color.

[00:09:44]
Pick one that's below the line so that you know that you have enough color contrast for people with low vision. Okay, so then we have RGBA. You saw that we used RGBA here. Let me just update so that we're actually on track, okay. [INAUDIBLE] is the red, the green, the blue, and the alpha, and these are the different values.

[00:10:08]
So 20% is 33.
>> Estelle Weyl: 75% is BF, and then we have can I use, oops. And so far, it does not work in IE or Edge, and it's coming soon, I guess, in the Samsung internet browser, but it's working in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
>> Estelle Weyl: Did I tell you we're going to make ugly stuff today?

[00:10:38]

>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
>> Estelle Weyl: This qualifies. Okay, so change the colors above.
>> Estelle Weyl: What does currentColor do? So the background, the color is this, right? And then I said, or the color, rather, is this form of pink, so let's just call it pink. Because I can't read HSL because I'm not a designer.

[00:11:06]
So the thing is the background, did you see how the background changed to pink when I did that? So let's see royal blue. So I'm changing the color and then the current color changed value. So the background changed value because the current color changed value. So current color is what ever color the foreground color, or the text color, is at this time.

[00:11:36]
So if I did border solid, it's good to be that current color, right? If I said border solid three pixels, it stays the same, because the default it, and if I do current color, it stays the same. But if I change this to green, the border is going to change because I use current color which is whatever the color is.

[00:12:08]
Okay, so a few tips, transparent is RGB 80 is a transparent black. Current color is a current text color. Accessibility, color should never be the only means of providing information to your user. So if your text is black and your links are dark green and not underlined, some people can't see it.

[00:12:29]
If your text is red and your links are green, you have no taste, but also some people can't read it, because they're color blind. It's either low vision needs high contrast, or a lot of people have, 10 percent of men have color blindness. I used ask sometimes in sessions is if anyone here is colorblind and apparently that is not a polite thing to ask.

[00:12:50]
So I don't ask that anymore.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then appearance,
>> Estelle Weyl: I have no clue why this is on this slide, but it's a good segue, so it's probably gonna come up next. Appearance is a property that allows you to change the appearance of elements. So by default, the browser will say the appearance of a button looks like a button and you can actually use appearance to change that.

[00:13:19]
So we've talked about alpha transparency which is very different than opacity.
