[00:00:01]
>> Estelle Weyl: So, colors. All these colors have the exact same value, they're all white. So you can declare it white, you can have a three-digit hexadecimal value, a six-digit hexadecimal value, and you can also have an eight-digit hexadecimal value. This might be new to some people, but the six characters are basically the white from above, and the last two Fs means 100% opaque.

[00:00:28]
So we now have a digit hexadecimal values will has to be, so it's RGBA, is basically what it is. Then we have RGB, which is red, green, blue, and you can either use zero, to 255 or you can use percents from 0 to 100. You cannot combine the two, that is incorrect.

[00:00:49]
You can't put percents on some and 0 to 255 on the other. So then we have RGBA, which is the same thing but with the last value being the opacity. In this case we're trying to get to one, so it's 100% opaque, or 1. Then we have hsl and hsla, which is hue, saturation, and lightness, which if you use Photoshop it's similar to hue, saturation and brightness, I think?

[00:01:15]
Yeah, hsb. And we have hsla, which is the same thing but with an alphatransparency at the end. And then we have two other things which is the key term of transparent and the key term of currentColor. currentColor is the current color of the text. So let's go first to the white, which is the name key terms.

[00:01:41]
We've got a bunch of them in CSS 2 and CSS 3 or in CSS 2. The only one that was added since then is Rebecca Purple. So the coauthor of this book, Eric Myer, his daughter passed away on her sixth birthday. And because he's the Oprah of CSS, and his duaghter's name was Rebecca and her favorite color was purple, in his honor they actually, and it was a color that was not yet used.

[00:02:14]
So I believe it's 536. It's one of my favorite colors actually, it's 639 rather. So that's the only that's been added since the original. Then, we have currentColor. And currentColor is a special color, and it's uses a default for a lot of things. So if you do boarder, and do border solid, three pixels or just border solid.

[00:02:43]
When you do a border, we'll cover that later, but borders you have to declare what type of border it is and that's all you have to declare. The other two values are default. They default to medium, which is three pixels wide in most browsers. And it default to currentColor as the color, which is the color of the text.

[00:03:03]

>> Estelle Weyl: There's other name color such as current color, which I've become deprecated. So these will work in a lot of browsers and they're just here for legacy reasons, just to remind you like if you actually hit this This was valid at one point.
>> Estelle Weyl: Then we have RGB and RGBA.

[00:03:23]
So all colors, well, that's not true. All colors used to be RGB, whether it was hexadecimal notation or RGB notation. Now we have HSL, which is different. And we also had CMKY, which is cyan, magenta, which is for print. I don't know if that still exists or not.

[00:03:42]
So, when we have hexadecimal notation, the first two digits are the red, the second two digits are the green, the third two digits are the blue. Similarly, when we have RGB, it stands for red, green, blue. That's what the r, and g, and the b stand for. As I said earlier, you can have it with numbers from 0 to 255 with 0 being black, or complete lack of color and 255 being a complete saturation of color.

[00:04:14]
Or you can do percents, with 0 being complete lack of color and 100% being complete saturation. And then we can also add an alpha transparency if we add the a at the end. So in this case, I used percents on latter one and 0 through 255 on the prior one.

[00:04:34]
Again, you can't mix those up. And what I could have done there as well is put 40, BF, AC, like CC or something like that. No, 66 probably, for 0.2, I don't know what 0.2 actually is. But, I could have put those eight digit codes, but we'll cover that in a second.

[00:04:57]
Then we have HSLA colors which are hue, saturation, lightness and alpha transparency. So the hues go from 0 which is red, through to orange, through to yellow, I passed yellow. Yellow's in there somewhere.
>> Estelle Weyl: Through to green, and blue, and purple, and back to red. So this right here, that thing right there, is actually 360 separate spans with each color in there, that's how I did that.

[00:05:35]
I could have just used a gradient, but why make things easier when I can put 360 divs in there. Saturation, 100% saturation means full of color and 0% saturation is always going to be a grey cuz it means the color's completely non saturated. Generally, you wanna go with the 100 there.

[00:05:57]
And lightness, 100% is always gonna be white, 0 is always gonna be black, and 50% is kind of the midpoint of super bright color.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then alpha transparency you have fully opaque and somewhat transparent. And the reason that you can still see HSLA colors right there, is because I have text shadow on there.

[00:06:26]
So I have a color that is alpha transparent but the text shadow is not. So box shadows are actually just shadows on the outside or on the inside of an element. Whereas text shadow is actually behind the whole text, it's a copy of the text in the shadow form and you can move it, but it's actually a shadow of the whole text.

[00:06:53]

>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, then I have this little converter that I reprogrammed it for this talk and I hope that it works, cuz it worked a month ago when I reprogrammed it. It takes a long time to make 702 slides. So here,
>> Estelle Weyl: If I change the alpha transparency, I can actually figure out what 0.2 is.

[00:07:18]
0.2 is 33. Remember when I was trying to figure it out? So here is my color converter. I have a GitHub repo, you can use it, it's open source. It basically allows you to pick any color you want and any alpha transparency you want. But do you need this?

[00:07:38]

>> Estelle Weyl: Let me show you a cool feature, lets me go alpha transparency there, okay. I'm going to go and check my inspector, I'm going to go look at this div here, and it says the background color is rgb(245, 148, 148). That's what it says, right? Okay, cool, we got it right, but if I open this up,

[00:08:04]

>> Estelle Weyl: It gives me the information here. And I can actually convert it to HSLA and hexadecimal right there.
>> Estelle Weyl: So you actually have a full-on color picker in your developer tools. Which is how I picked the hideous colors on the back of this slide deck. So I would pick a color, open it up, and then pick another color that I thought was nice, clashes just enough to make it hideous.

[00:08:31]
And then that's how I picked the colors.
>> Estelle Weyl: So let's get out of here, okay. Another feature in here is, yeah, you see I use Rebecca Purple a lot. This is the Rebecca Purple in royal blue deck and if I click on this text right here and,
>> Estelle Weyl: I go down to color,

[00:09:08]

>> Estelle Weyl: Anyone seeing color?
>> Estelle Weyl: Color, if I open this up here, do you see that white line right there? That is an accessibility feature. If I wanna make sure that I have enough contrast, which currently my contrast is at 11.9, which is serious contrast. But if I pick this color here, it'll say low contrast.

[00:09:31]
So actually, if you wanna make sure that you're site is accessible, there's accessibility features. But actually it's separate accessibility features, but within this right here, if you're gonna pick a color, pick one that's below the line, so that you know that you have enough color contrast for people with low vision.

[00:09:50]
Okay, so then we have RGBA. So you saw that we use RGBA here. Let me just update this, so that we're actually on track, okay. RGBA is the red, the green, the blue, and the alpha. And these are the different values. So 20% is 33. 75% is bf.

[00:10:13]
And then we have, can I use. Oops, and so far, it does not work in IE or Edge. And it's coming soon, I guess, in the Samsung Internet browser. But it's working in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
>> Estelle Weyl: Did I tell you we were gonna make ugly stuff today?

[00:10:38]

>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
>> Estelle Weyl: This qualifies. Okay, so change the colors above.
>> Estelle Weyl: What does currentColor do? So the background, the color is this, right? And then I said, or the color rather, is this form of pink. So let's just call it pink. Because I can't really read HSL because I'm not a designer.

[00:11:06]
So the thing is, the background, did you see how the background changed to pink when I did that? So let's see royal blue. So I'm changing the color and then the currentColor change value, so the background change value because the currentColor change value. So, currentColor is whatever color the foreground color or the text color is at this time.

[00:11:35]
So, if I did border solid, it's going to be that currentColor, right? If I said border solid 3 pixels, it stays the same because the default is. And then if I do currentcolor, it stays the same. But if I change this to green, the border is gonna change because I use current color and it's whenever the color is.

[00:12:04]
Okay, so a few tips, transparent is RGBA to transparent block. currentColor is the current text color. Accessibility, color should never be the only visual means of providing information to your user. So if your text is black, and your links are dark green and they're not underlined, some people can't see it.

[00:12:29]
If your text is red and your links are green, you have no taste. But also, some people can't read it because they're color blind. It's either low vision needs a high contrast. Or a lot of people have, 10% of men, have colorblindness. And I used to ask sometimes in sessions, is anyone here colorblind?

[00:12:48]
And apparently, that is not a polite thing to ask, so I don't ask that anymore.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then appearance, well, I have no clue why this is on the slide. But it's a good segue, so it's probably gonna come up next. Appearance is a property that allows you to change the appearance of elements.

[00:13:11]
So by default, the browser will say, like the appearance of a button looks like a button. And you can actually use appearance to change that. So, we've talked about alpha transparency, which is very different than opacity.
