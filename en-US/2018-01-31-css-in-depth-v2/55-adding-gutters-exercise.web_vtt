00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.050
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
let's talk about adding the gutters.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.380
So far I've added gutters I believe or
no did I not.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.740
I added gutters to make it look better,
but

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.570
I didn't tell you about it because this is
what it looks like without gutters, right?

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.070
That's ugly.

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.550
One of the nice things that we always,
you don't have to worry about margins.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.950
You always have the same amount
of margins between cells.

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.060
It's really nice to have a nice
layout with good white space.

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.090
White space makes websites
much more readable.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.850
So instead of saying, here's a paragraph
of text, and I want padding here and

11
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.840
then margins.

12
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.780
You can just say, well, there's gonna
be 20 pixels between any element, so

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.908
it's going to be legible.

14
00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:51.360
Okay, so,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We have three properties.

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.616
We have the grid-column-gap, the
grid-row-gap, and then just the shorthand,

16
00:00:56.616 --> 00:01:00.740
which is the grid-gap.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

17
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.750
Margin does actually still work.

18
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.990
On these, so let's go over here and
play with it.

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.020
So when I save grid row,
it's between each row.

20
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.870
When I save column gap,
it's between the columns.

21
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.390
When I undo this one right here,
it's gonna be the exact same.

22
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.320
Because the order is row, and then column.

23
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.010
So top to bottom, left right.

24
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.870
Which makes it less confusing than
when we were doing the tables.

25
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:47.240
Okay, so here let's just make
it 40 pixels and then 10.

26
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.390
And that might make you realize why you
probably just wanna do just one number

27
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.850
overall for column gap cause
that looks much better, right?

28
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.380
Having it even.

29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.090
You can use different units, right?

30
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.030
One m instead but
let's actually put margin on one of these.

31
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.183
Li nth-of-type(3)

32
00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:19.050
{margin: 20 px;.

33
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.884
So margin still works.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Box-sizing: border-box,

34
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:35.176
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I just wanted to see what

35
00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:41.000
that did and then we can put padding,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 30

36
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.133
pixels.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And it just changed

37
00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:49.938
the whole layout of the page.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because the FR

38
00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:52.690
unit is now a different length, right.

39
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.520
Before it maintained the same length, but

40
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.490
then now that I have added padding
that element is much bigger.

41
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.560
With between the margin and

42
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.900
the padding the element got much bigger,
which shrank the amount of free space.

43
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.360
Okay, so what I want you to do over
the next five minutes is to create a grid.

44
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.660
So there's a little thing here,
it says, try it out.

45
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.140
And I want you to create a grid
container with the display property.

46
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:29.090
I want you to create the columns and the
rows with either, or grid template area.

47
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.470
But we didn't go grid template area so
just forget there's an or

48
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.720
here and the word either.

49
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.470
Then optional added gutter
with grid gap or column
