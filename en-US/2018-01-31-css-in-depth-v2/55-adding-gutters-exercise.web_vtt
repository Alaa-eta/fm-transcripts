00:00:02.825 --> 00:00:05.848
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
let's talk about adding the gutters.

2
00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:09.322
So far, I added gutters I believe,
or no, did I not?

3
00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:13.044
I added gutters to make it look better but
I didn't tell you about it,

4
00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:16.460
because this is what a gut looks
like without gutters, right?

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.496
That's ugly.

6
00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:22.703
And one of the nice things, that way
you don't have to worry about margins,

7
00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:25.950
you always have the same amount
of margins between cells.

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.010
It's really nice to have a nice
layout with good white space,

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.090
white space makes websites
much more readable.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.850
So instead of saying, here's a paragraph
of text, and I want padding here and

11
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.840
then margins.

12
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.780
You can just say, well there's gonna
be 20 pixels between any element, so

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.870
it's going to be legible.

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.360
Okay, so we have three properties.

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.383
We have the grid column gap,
the grid row gap, and

16
00:00:56.383 --> 00:01:01.059
then just the short hand
which is the grid gap.

17
00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.002
And margin does actually
still work on these, so

18
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.990
let's go over here and play with it.

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.020
So when I say grid row,
it's between each row.

20
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.870
When I say column gap,
it's between the columns.

21
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260
When I undo this one right here,

22
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.320
it's gonna be the exact same because
the order is row and then column.

23
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.010
So top to bottom, left right.

24
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.870
Which makes it less confusing than
when we were doing the tables.

25
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:46.219
Okay, so here let's just make
it 40 pixels, and then 10.

26
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.390
And that might make you realize why
you probably just wanna do one number

27
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.850
overall for column gap,
cuz that looks much better, right?

28
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.380
Having it even.

29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.964
You can use different units, right?

30
00:02:01.964 --> 00:02:07.035
One m instead, but
let's actually put margin on one of these.

31
00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:13.719
Li:nth-of-type(3).

32
00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.731
Margin 20 pixels.

33
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.145
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So margin still works.

34
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:26.297
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Box-sizing border-box.

35
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:37.289
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I just
wanted to see what that did.

36
00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:43.849
And then we can put padding, 30 pixels.

37
00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.622
And it just changed the whole
layout of the page because

38
00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:52.460
the FR unit is now a different length.

39
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.480
Right, before it maintained
the same length.

40
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.794
But then now that I added padding,
that element is much bigger.

41
00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:03.434
Between the margin and the padding,
the element got much bigger,

42
00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:06.770
which shrank the amount of free space.

43
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.147
Okay, so what I want you to do over
the next five minutes is to create a grid.

44
00:03:13.147 --> 00:03:16.568
So there's a little thing here says,
try it out.

45
00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:19.926
And I want you to create a grid
container with the display property.

46
00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:25.025
I want you to create the columns and
the rows with either or

47
00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:30.340
grid template area, but
we didn't go over grid template area.

48
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.959
So just forget that there's an or
here, and the word either.

49
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.217
And then optional add
a gutter with grid gap or

50
00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:43.261
grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap.
