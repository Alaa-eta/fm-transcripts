00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.069
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Radial gradients have
two things in common with the linear

2
00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.193
gradients, which are color stops and
color hints.

3
00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:14.778
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The thing to
remember in terms of the position,

4
00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:17.668
is you wanna use the at, keyword.

5
00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:22.035
The position that you're declaring is
the center-point of your radial gradient,

6
00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.441
it's the center of the circle or
the ellipse.

7
00:00:27.128 --> 00:00:32.874
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And if the size
specifies as a circle or if it's omitted,

8
00:00:32.874 --> 00:00:39.594
the length can be a length or
percent, so let's look here at this.

9
00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:44.250
This is the default, by default,
a background gradient that is

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.177
radial just like linear will be
at the center, it'll be centered.

11
00:00:49.177 --> 00:00:53.637
Here we're saying an elipse at center,
default is a lipse, default is at center.

12
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:58.459
And then I say pale golden rod at 0%,

13
00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:02.691
and rebeccapurple at 100%.

14
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:08.123
If I said at 50,50, at 25, 25, rather,

15
00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:16.189
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or aa 5.

16
00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:23.965
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: One of the other things
is that it basically has the same

17
00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:26.463
aspect ratio as the parent.

18
00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:32.351
So the aspect ratio of my gradient is
basically in this corner right here.

19
00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:37.167
If I actually do 0, 0,
the pale goldenrod it would

20
00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:40.784
be right here, it's pale goldenrod.

21
00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:47.225
Right here at the farthest
corner it's rebeccapurple and

22
00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:52.226
the gradient line
basically goes like that.

23
00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:57.050
In terms of position, you can use the same
values as the background position property

24
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.658
that we used earlier today.

25
00:01:58.658 --> 00:02:02.844
You wanna include the at key
term in front of it though,

26
00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:07.579
with background position we
don't include the end, right.

27
00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.233
But when you're declaring
the radio gradient,

28
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:13.792
you can also add a background
position to radio gradient and say,

29
00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:16.782
I want this radio gradient
background name to be here.

30
00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:20.085
But within the same text of the radio
gradient, you're using the at key term.

31
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.173
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There are no angles
because it's a circle, right.

32
00:02:26.173 --> 00:02:29.150
So it's going around, or
it's a ellipse that's going around.

33
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.289
So it's called a gradient
ray not a gradient line.

34
00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.783
So let's talk about the position.

35
00:02:36.783 --> 00:02:41.147
This little black dot,
you see how it says black 1% 1% so

36
00:02:41.147 --> 00:02:43.870
it's gonna go black from 0 to 1%.

37
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.462
And the midpoint,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There,

38
00:02:48.462 --> 00:02:49.557
it's a solid black circle.

39
00:02:49.557 --> 00:02:53.237
Wherever the midpoint is of my
gradient that's where it's gonna be.

40
00:02:53.237 --> 00:02:58.100
So play along with this, if I move it to
the 25% mark, i t's 25% from the left and

41
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.333
95% from the top.

42
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:03.735
And here we've changed it to 15%,
it's up near the top and

43
00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:07.218
you can see that that gradient changed,
right.

44
00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:12.738
There's definitely more purple and
the yellow' here in the center.

45
00:03:12.738 --> 00:03:19.832
So the position is within the background
image size that you have.

46
00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:23.592
So if we actually said,

47
00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:28.480
background-size: 300px

48
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.616
by 400px; all right,

49
00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:39.356
background,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Actually,

50
00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:44.073
let me just make it 400 by 300,
cuz this looks ugly.

51
00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:50.192
And I know I wanna make things look ugly,
but not that ugly, background-repeat.

52
00:03:53.672 --> 00:03:56.926
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
I'm just gonna have a single one.

53
00:03:56.926 --> 00:04:02.182
And then I'm just gonna add
background position and

54
00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:06.721
put it in the bottom right so
we can look at it,

55
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:11.516
background position, 100%, 100%.

56
00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:14.243
And I spelled it wrong, okay.

57
00:04:14.243 --> 00:04:18.202
So this migrating on the bottom corner,
it's a four, it's a background image that

58
00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:22.248
is 400 by 300 pixels, right,
it's 400 pixels wide, 300 pixels tall.

59
00:04:22.248 --> 00:04:26.991
If you remember from
the background position property,

60
00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:32.621
the bottom line right hand corner
of the background image in the back

61
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:38.079
right corner of the parent,
thatâ€™s just background position.

62
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:44.001
But, in terms of the ellipse itself the
center of the ellipse is 25% from the left

63
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:50.277
and 15% from the top of that background
image size, whatever that size was, right.

64
00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:53.756
We can make it 500 and 400,

65
00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:58.103
it's going to move to be within that, but

66
00:04:58.103 --> 00:05:03.211
I wanna put it down here so
we can actually see it.

67
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:10.530
I could do circle and
you can barely see a change.

68
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.883
But if I did a background size,

69
00:05:14.883 --> 00:05:19.405
this 600, let us do 100,

70
00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:23.261
all right circle ellipse.

71
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:26.280
Do you see the difference,

72
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.538
this went really long and
not that tall, okay.

73
00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:36.583
And let's do it at the 50%
mark from the top and

74
00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:39.298
then change it to circle.

75
00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:43.789
So here you can see that that ellipse
is a really long ellipse, right.

76
00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.800
If I do circle, see, it's rounder, it's
not going all the way off to the right.

77
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.190
I mean, it is actually going
off all the way to the right,

78
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.319
like this is where the 100% is.

79
00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:01.529
Okay, so we kinda did position already.

80
00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.095
You can actually use the four
point background position.

81
00:06:05.095 --> 00:06:10.035
Remember when we were talking about
the four, when you could say 15

82
00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:14.559
pixels bottom or right,
10 pixels, bottom, 10 pixels.

83
00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:16.527
So you can, with gradients,

84
00:06:16.527 --> 00:06:20.481
you can actually use that four
point background position.

85
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:24.136
Who here had background position
with four points being new today?

86
00:06:24.136 --> 00:06:25.467
Was that new for people?

87
00:06:25.467 --> 00:06:28.629
Okay, who here knew it?

88
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.396
Who here didn't know it?

89
00:06:30.396 --> 00:06:31.427
Okay [LAUGH].

90
00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:36.381
So yeah, it can be used not just
in background position, but

91
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:39.695
in actual deposition of your gradient.
