00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.579
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Radial gradients have two
things in common with the linear gradients

2
00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.854
which are color stops and color hints.

3
00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.899
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The thing to remember
in terms of the position is you

4
00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.210
wanna use the at keyword.

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.868
The position that you're declaring is
the center point of your radial gradient,

6
00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:24.175
the center of the circle or the ellipse.

7
00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:32.483
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And if the size
specifies as a circle or if it's omitted,

8
00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:37.240
the length can be a length or percent.

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.830
So let's look here at this.

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.310
This is the default.

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.650
By default, a background gradient
that is radial, just like linear,

12
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.530
will be at the center.

13
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.420
It'll be centered.

14
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.750
Here we're saying an ellipse at center.

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.647
Default is ellipse, default is at center.

16
00:00:53.647 --> 00:01:00.705
And then I say palegoldenrod at 0% and
rebeccapurple at 100%.

17
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.331
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I said at 25, 25,

18
00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:15.811
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or at 5.

19
00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:23.744
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: One of the other things
is that it basically has the same

20
00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:26.207
aspect ratio as the parent.

21
00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:32.050
So the aspect ratio of my gradient is
basically in this corner right here,

22
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.007
and if I actually do 0,
0, the palegoldenrod,

23
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.703
it will be right here, it's palegoldenrod.

24
00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:44.947
Right here at the farthest corner,
it's rebeccapurple.

25
00:01:44.947 --> 00:01:47.893
And the gradient line
basically goes like that.

26
00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:54.382
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So in terms of position,
you can use the same values as

27
00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:57.837
the background position property
that we used earlier today.

28
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:02.295
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You wanna include
the at key term in front of it though.

29
00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:07.406
With background position on background
images we don't include the M, right?

30
00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:10.649
But in the radial gradient,
when you're declaring a radial gradient,

31
00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.519
you can also add a background
position to the radial gradient and

32
00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.020
say I want this radial gradient
background image to be here.

33
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.711
But within the synax of the radial
gradient, you're using the at key term.

34
00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.960
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There are no angles.

35
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.410
Because it's a circle, right?

36
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.440
So it's going around or
it's an ellipse, so it's going around.

37
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.860
So it's called a gradient ray,
not a gradient line.

38
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.000
So let's talk about the position.

39
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.440
This little black dot,
see how it says black 1%, 1%?

40
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.680
So it's gonna go black from 0
to 1% in the midpoint there.

41
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.050
It's a solid black circle wherever
the midpoint is of my gradient,

42
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.400
that's where it's gonna be.

43
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.054
So play along with this.

44
00:02:54.054 --> 00:03:00.105
If I move it to the 25% mark, it's 25%
from the left and 95% from the top.

45
00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:03.425
And here we change it to 15%,
it's up near the top.

46
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:06.693
And you can see that that
gradient changed, right?

47
00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:11.251
There's definitely more purple and
the yellow's in here in the center.

48
00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:16.934
So the position is within the background

49
00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:20.946
image size that you have, so

50
00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:26.632
if we actually said background-size:

51
00:03:26.632 --> 00:03:30.824
300px 400px, right?

52
00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:34.164
Background.

53
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.876
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Actually let's make
it 400 by 300 cuz this looks ugly.

54
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.197
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And I know I wanna
make things look ugly but not that ugly.

55
00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:49.786
Background-repeat.

56
00:03:54.124 --> 00:03:57.635
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so I'm just gonna
have this single one and then I'm just

57
00:03:57.635 --> 00:04:02.222
gonna add background position and put it
in the bottom-right so we can look at it.

58
00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:07.582
Background-position: 100%

59
00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:12.944
100%, and I spelled it wrong.

60
00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:16.297
Okay, so
there's my gradient in the bottom corner.

61
00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:20.290
It's a background image that
is 400 by 300 pixels, right?

62
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.520
It's 400 pixels wide, 300 pixels tall.

63
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.182
If we remember from
the background position property,

64
00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:32.139
the bottom right-hand corner
of the background image is in

65
00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.110
the bottom right-hand
corner of the parent.

66
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.320
That's just background position.

67
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.000
But in terms of the ellipse itself,
the center of the ellipse is 25% from

68
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.360
the left and 15% from the top
of that background image size.

69
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.893
Whatever that size was, right?

70
00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:53.665
We could make it 500 and 400.

71
00:04:56.677 --> 00:04:58.633
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's going
to move to be within that but

72
00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:01.079
I wanna put it down here so
we can actually see it.

73
00:05:04.268 --> 00:05:04.832
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I could do circle.

74
00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:14.119
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And you can barely see a
change but if I did a background size 600.

75
00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:16.238
Now let's do 800.

76
00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:17.667
All right?

77
00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:18.541
Circle.

78
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:23.450
Ellipse.

79
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.280
Do you see the difference?

80
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.750
This one's really long and not that tall.

81
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.075
Okay.

82
00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:36.229
And let's do it at the 50%
mark from the top and

83
00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.009
then change it to circle.

84
00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.475
So here you could see that that ellipse
is a really long ellipse, right?

85
00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:46.866
If I just circle, see it's rounder.

86
00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:48.379
It's not going all
the way off to the right.

87
00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:54.156
It is actually going off all the way to
the right, this is where the 100% mark is.

88
00:05:54.156 --> 00:05:55.905
Okay.

89
00:05:55.905 --> 00:06:00.610
So we kind of did position already.

90
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.580
You can actually use the four
point background position.

91
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.520
Remember when we were talking about the 4
when you can say 15 pixels bottom or

92
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.500
right 10 pixels bottom 10 pixels?

93
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.300
So with gradients, you can actually use
that four point background position.

94
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.380
Who here had background position
with four points being new today?

95
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.850
Was that new for people?

96
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.350
Okay, who here knew it?

97
00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.165
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Who here didn't know it?

98
00:06:30.165 --> 00:06:33.429
Okay.
[LAUGH] So yeah, it can be used not just

99
00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:39.150
in background position but
in actual position of your gradient.
