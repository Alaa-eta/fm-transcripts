>> Steve Kinney: So, to better understand grids, we have terminology. A grid line is a line basically in the gutter. There's one on the left of the grid, there's one on the right of the grid, and then there's one between each row, and each column. There's one on top and there's one on the bottom.

[00:00:19]
So if you have a three by three grid, you actually have four lines going vertically and four lines going horizontally. A grid cell is any cell such as the number ten.
>> Steve Kinney: A grid area is a space basically, I have no clue what a grid area is. It's basically say this area here because you can give certain things names, and we're gonna cover that later on.

[00:00:48]
A grid track is either a grid row or a grid column. It's any area between two grid lines, vertically or horizontally. So grid row is one that's horizontal, and a grid column is one that's vertical. And then the gutter is the grid gap that's in between here, that white space.

[00:01:08]
I'm gonna just open this up in the debugger right here. So this is the grid gap here. This is a grid cell. Seven through 12 is a grid row. Two through 20, or there might be some below, is a grid column. And then the grid line is this line on the left, the line in between here, the line between here, the line between three and four.

[00:01:32]
The line between four and five, the line between five and six, and the line right after number six. So that's a grid line.
>> Steve Kinney: Okay, so let's see, is it ready? Let's check, can I use and have a network for us? So can I use?
>> Steve Kinney: And if we go to grid.

[00:01:57]
Look at all that beautiful green. It dropped into production, I think on October 17th in MS Edge. And since then, it's basically every single Evergreen browser has it. Older versions of IE, so if I show all of them, have an older syntax of grid. So you can actually use grid with all of the edge and strong with IE10, but it has a slightly different syntax.

[00:02:25]
I'm not gonna cover that syntax today.
>> Steve Kinney: Okay. So the properties we've seen so far are the display element with grid or in line grid. We've shown grid template columns which you might not have noticed, but that was basically determining the size of the different columns. We created a grid gap, there was room between the gaps.

[00:02:51]
On the child, we placed that pink element using grid columns and grid row. And we also add two values that you may have never seen before. For the grid template columns, we had used a unit called fr, and we had repeated some stuff. So we're gonna cover all of that right now.

[00:03:13]
So first let's start by setting up the grid. To set up the grid, [COUGH] we have properties that are on the parent. We have the displayed property. We have the displayed template columns, which says basically the width of all the columns. Grid template rows, which is the height of all the rows.

[00:03:37]
We have a short hand for it which is grid template. And then, we could have a grid column gap and a grid row gap. Which there's a shorthand, and you could just say grid gap, and not just the vertical and horizontal spacing. In grid, all of your vertical gaps are gonna be the same size, and all of your horizontal gaps are gonna be the same length as well.

[00:03:59]
But those could be two different lengths. But you can't have, and you probably don't want, different sized gaps between things.
>> Steve Kinney: So we're gonna cover those first, and then we're gonna cover grid items. And then, we're gonna cover the other properties of how to align whole rows.
