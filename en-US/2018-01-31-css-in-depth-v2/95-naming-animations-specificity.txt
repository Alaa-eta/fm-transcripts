>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so far we talked about the keyframes, but we haven't actually animated anything. We've just created the keyframe animation. We gave it a name, and that name is what you're going to use to attach it to an element. So the only thing that is required to make an animation work is the animation name, cuz there are default values for everything.

[00:00:21]
So if you recall, when we overwrote the important, we just gave it the animation name and then the keyword forwards. And I'll talk about forwards, but forwards makes stuff stay on the 100% mark. That's all we did, we just said, and it worked, right? There was only two properties, declare their name and one other thing.

[00:00:38]
So we have a Base CSS, which is our pencil. The width is 100 pixels, the text-align to the right, the border-bottom is 10 pixels, cuz I want to make it look like it's drawing the little border on the bottom. And then after I put the pencil, I positioned it absolutely.

[00:00:53]
I wanted the pencil to be lower than it would be, so that is why I put it in the after. And then I have this keyframe called drawALine. And it goes from 0 to 100%, where the width is 0 and the width is 100%, where it goes from green to blue.

[00:01:08]
But I didn't attach it to the pencil yet, right? The pencil doesn't have any animation. So let's attach the animation. I say animation drawALine and duration 3 seconds. If there's no duration, it's 0 seconds and it's kind of a moot point. So here, it's going from green to blue over 6 seconds.

[00:01:28]
Wanna see that again? Let's make it faster, so we're not as annoyed. Over 3 seconds. So I gave it the animation name and duration. By default, it only happens once.
>> Estelle Weyl: I don't know why I put this slide in this order. But if you have more than one animation name, the order of precedence is the one it goes and starts the first one, second and then third.

[00:01:58]
So it's actually blue, because the blue overwrote the background color property for the green and the red. So if you have many keyframe animations with the same property going on at the same time, cuz you can have multiple animations at the same time. Whichever one is declared last that will be the property, okay.

[00:02:20]

>> Estelle Weyl: We already talked about specificity. But in case someone is coming to this deck without doing the whole deck,
>> Estelle Weyl: A CSS can overwrite important. So just know that animations will work even if there's a declaration of important on the property originally. So here, I did say that I want the border to be black and solid and 5 pixels.

[00:02:49]
But because I have keyframe animation going on, it's actually changing from red to orange, because the animation right now is active.
>> Estelle Weyl: And I already covered this as well. Do not include important in your keyframe animations. That will not work.
