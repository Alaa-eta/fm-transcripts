>> Steve Kinney: Okay, so so far we've talked about the keyframes but we haven't actually animated anything. We've just created the keyframe animation. We gave it a name and that name is what you're going to use to attach it to an element. So the only thing that is required to make an animation work is the animation name cuz there are default values for everything.

[00:00:21]
So if you recall, when we overwrote the import, we just gave it the animation name and then the keyword forwards. And I'll talk about forwards but forwards make stuff stay on the 100% mark. That's all we did. And it worked, right? There was only two properties declared the name and one other thing.

[00:00:38]
So we have a base CSS which is our pencil, the width is 100 pixels, the text aligned to the right. The border bottom is ten pixels cuz I wanna make it look like it's drawing the little border in the bottom. And then after I put the pencil a position, absolutely I wanted the pencil to be lower than it would be.

[00:00:55]
So that's why I put in the after. And then I have this keyframe called drawALine, and it goes from 0 to 100%, where the width is 0 and the width is 100%, where it goes from green to blue. But I didn't attach it to the pencil yet, right?

[00:01:09]
The pencil doesn't have any animation. So let's attach the animation. I say animation drawALine and duration three seconds. If there is no duration, it's zero seconds and it's kind of a mood point. So here's going from green to blue over three seconds, for six seconds. Wanna see that again?

[00:01:30]
Let's make it faster so we're not this annoyed. Over three seconds. So I gave it the animation name and duration, by default, it only happens once.
>> Steve Kinney: I don't know why I put this slide in this order but if you have more than one animation name, the order of precedence is the one, it goes in first, that's the first one, second, and then third.

[00:01:59]
It's actually blue because the blue overwrote the background color property for the green and the red. So if you have many keyframe animations with the same property going on at the same time, cuz you can have multiple animations in an element at the same time. Whichever one is declared last, that will be the property.

[00:02:16]
Okay.
>> Steve Kinney: We already talked about specificity but in case someone is coming to this deck without doing the whole deck,
>> Steve Kinney: The CSS can overwrite important, so just know that animations will work even if there's a declaration of important on the property originally. So here I did say that I want the border to be black and solid and five pixels.

[00:02:49]
But because I have a keyframe animation going on, it's actually changing from red to orange because the animation right now is active.
>> Steve Kinney: And I already covered this as well. Do not include important in your keyframe animations, that will not work.
