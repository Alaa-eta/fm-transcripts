00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.216
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, let's go on to
the next feature, which is placement,

2
00:00:05.216 --> 00:00:06.200
placing a grid item.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.490
So, earlier,
I talked about the grid lines.

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.940
And the grid lines are in red,
and the grid items are in blue.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.310
So if you see,
I have a three by three grid, but

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.010
I have four grid lines,
one, two, three, and four.

7
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.450
Across and down.

8
00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:26.122
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
when I place an item, I say basically,

9
00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:30.183
at which grid line does it start,
and at which grid line does it end,

10
00:00:30.183 --> 00:00:33.990
both in the direction of the row and
the column?

11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.020
So I have four properties for that, or
several, even more than four properties.

12
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.890
I can say my item grid rows start at two.

13
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.020
So it starts at the second line, and
it ends at the fourth row grid line.

14
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.850
And it starts at the column
start of the second grid line,

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.000
which is right in front
of the second column, and

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.260
it ends at the fifth column line,
which is after the fourth column.

17
00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:05.666
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There is actually
shorthand for grid-row-start and

18
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.590
grid-row-end, which is just grid-row.

19
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.530
So you put the number,
and then you put a slash.

20
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.091
And then there's also a shorthand for
grid-column-start and

21
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:20.860
grid-column-end, which is
just grid-column 2 /5.

22
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.410
So it's grid-column-start,
slash, grid-column-end.

23
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.090
And then I could do shorthand, and

24
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.361
basically say grid-row-start,
grid-column-start,

25
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:41.190
grid-row-end, grid-column-end,
and I hope you all memorize that.

26
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.140
It's a little bit complex, but just
remember, it goes start, start, and end.

27
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.760
And I should have a slide somewhere,
where it actually says,

28
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.490
a little bit later, I elaborate if
you have fewer than four values.

29
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.510
I should have put it right here,
but, apparently, I didn't.

30
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.930
Because I want to play with it right away.

31
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.770
So let´s play with this right away.

32
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.520
Here I have grid row start at 2,
grid-row-end at 4.

33
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.780
So it´s starting at the second line,
third line, fourth line.

34
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.230
So it's going from two to four.

35
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.689
So those are the rows
that it goes through.

36
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.630
And then it says,
which columns is it going through?

37
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.390
It's starting at the second column line,
and it goes to the fifth.

38
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.672
I could do
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: and

39
00:02:34.672 --> 00:02:37.670
that's the exact same thing, all right?

40
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.114
And I could do grid-column 2 / 5.

41
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.130
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
that's the same thing.

42
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.147
Now, if I wanna do just grid
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Area.

43
00:02:59.187 --> 00:03:00.320
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's not what we want.

44
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.254
We actually want 2 and 5.

45
00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:08.560
And that brings it back to the same thing.

46
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.853
Because it was,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's

47
00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:19.784
grid-row start, grid-column start,

48
00:03:19.784 --> 00:03:24.532
grid rows end, grid column end.
