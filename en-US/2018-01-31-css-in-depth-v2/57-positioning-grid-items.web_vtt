00:00:02.726 --> 00:00:05.348
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So let's go onto
the next feature which is placement,

2
00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:06.488
of placing a grid item.

3
00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:10.932
So earlier I talked about the grid
lines and the grid lines are in red and

4
00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:12.676
the grid items are in blue.

5
00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:16.313
So if you see, I have a 3x3 grid but

6
00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:22.150
I have 4 grid lines 1, 2,
3, and 4 across and down.

7
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.272
So when I place an item, I say basically,

8
00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:30.195
at which grid line does it start and
at which grid line does it end?

9
00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:33.214
Both in the direction of the row and
the column.

10
00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:38.126
So I have four properties for that or
several, even more than four properties.

11
00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:42.690
I can say, my item grid row starts at two.

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.357
So it starts at the second line and
it ends at the fourth row grid line.

13
00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:51.998
And it starts at the column start
of the second grid line which

14
00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:55.092
is right in front of the second column and

15
00:00:55.092 --> 00:01:00.112
it ends at the fifth column line
which is after the fourth column.

16
00:01:02.898 --> 00:01:06.030
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's actually
shorthand for grid-row-start and

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.590
grid-row-end, which is just grid-row.

18
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.250
So you put the number and
then you put a slash.

19
00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:17.409
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then there's also
a shorthand for grid-column-start and

20
00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.094
grid-column-end, which is
just grid-column: 2 / 5.

21
00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:27.351
So the grid-column-start
/ grid-column-end.

22
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:33.165
And then I could do shorthand and
basically say grid-row-start,

23
00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:38.880
grid-column-start, grid-row-end,
grid-column-end.

24
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.627
And I hope you all memorized that,
it's a little bit complex.

25
00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:46.113
But just remember,
it goes start, start, end, end.

26
00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:52.341
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And I should have
a slide somewhere where it actually says,

27
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:56.506
a little bit later, I elaborate if
you have fewer than four values.

28
00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:57.450
I should have put it right here but

29
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.930
apparently I didn't because I
wanted to play with it right away.

30
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.326
So let's play with this right away.

31
00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:10.213
Here I have grid-row-start at 2,
grid-row-end at 4.

32
00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:15.780
So it's starting at the second line,
third line, fourth line.

33
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.070
So it's going from 2 to 4.

34
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.689
So those are the rows
that it goes through.

35
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.630
And then it says which
columns is it going through?

36
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.390
It's starting at the second column
line and it goes through the fifth.

37
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.626
I could do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

38
00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:37.670
that's the exact same thing, right?

39
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.130
And I could do grid-column,
2/5 and that's the same thing.

40
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.295
Now if I wanna do just grid,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Area,

41
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.637
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's not what we want,

42
00:03:02.637 --> 00:03:06.277
we actually want 2 and 5.

43
00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:09.922
And that brings it back to the same thing,
because it was,

44
00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:16.335
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's grid-row-start,

45
00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:21.777
grid-column-start, grid-row-end,

46
00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:24.575
grid-column-end.
