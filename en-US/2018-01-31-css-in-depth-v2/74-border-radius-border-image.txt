>> Estelle Weyl: So let's talk about border-radius. In the upper right-hand corner, we have border-radius is 0, which is the default. I put two different colors on it so that you could see where the angles are. And when we learned how to make triangles or looked to making triangles yesterday with generated content, that was the power, we could actually use those angles.

[00:00:24]
The thing is when you're doing border-radius, you start getting kind of funky looking stuff. Like the border radius at 20 pixels and the border radius at 50 pixels, it's just a little bit weird. So do not prefix border-radius. I see [INAUDIBLE] border-radius in so many different things and I think it's been supported since Firefox 3.6.

[00:00:48]
Who here is still supporting Firefox 3.6? Right, so why do I see [INAUDIBLE] border-radius all over the place? You also don't wanna use webkit border-radius cuz even though Android 2.3 still needs it, it slows the device down. So a person is already on a crappy device and you're just making it a lot worse.

[00:01:09]
So don't ever prefix this and I believe last year on the SaaS homepage, where I was showing you how to use functions, it actually expanded adding Moz border-radius and I'm kinda like, please. So when you're using pre-processors or post-processors, make sure you're not adding croft when you don't need it.

[00:01:31]
Okay, so to make a circle, you need to have an element that has the same height and width. Otherwise, it's going to be an ellipse. But if you wanna make an elipse or a circle, and a circle is a type of elipse, just use border-radius 50%. If you put two values, it's different than putting two values with a slash.

[00:01:54]
So in the third example, we have border-radius 10 pixels, 30 pixels which means the upper left hand corner and the bottom right hand corner have a border radius of 10 pixels, and the upper right hand corner and the lower left hand corner have a radius of 30 pixels which is much prettier than the thing we are doing next which is 10 pixels / 30 pixels.

[00:02:22]
That's basically saying, horizontally, make the border-radius 30 pixels and vertically, make it 10 pixels, or the other way around. And then we can do really ugly stuff, cuz we can put all four values. The bottom one, that's ugly. That's called uglification. And it's something we're learning a lot about today.

[00:02:44]
That's how to make an ugly thing,
>> Estelle Weyl: On the web. So that's saying basically, the upper left-hand is 10 pixels by 30 pixels, the upper right is 35 by 35. The bottom right is 20 by 5 and the bottom left is 15 by 5, and that's just ugly but you can do that.

[00:03:11]
So just realize that that's what border-radius is doing. So let's just play with border-radius for 45 seconds. Try to make this as ugly as possible. Another thing to note on this, as you're making this ugly, is you see the original corner would have been here. And that's where this is going.

[00:03:29]
It's going to that mark right there. So it's actually cutting off. It's on the bottom edge.
>> Estelle Weyl: Because your borde- radius will curve in but your colors will stay angled.
>> Estelle Weyl: And if you just get rid of the slash, that's actually not ugly anymore.
>> Estelle Weyl: So realize that the slash is in the syntax and now that you know it, let's see if we even use it anywhere.

[00:04:12]

>> Estelle Weyl: Now all of the examples with slashes are ugly.
>> Estelle Weyl: And the thing is if you're going to use the shorthand or the longhand of a border,
>> Estelle Weyl: Or is it top left radius, top-right, yeah. So if I wanna make this ugly, I actually just do 40% or 20%.

[00:04:45]

>> Estelle Weyl: Right? That's ugly but when I have two different values, the different value for vertical and horizontal, so the vertical is 20 pixels, then the horizontal is 50%. There's no slash, so there's only slash in the longhand, not in the shorthand.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, let's go onto border images.

[00:05:07]
So what is a border image or how is it supported?
>> Estelle Weyl: Considering it's been around, let's just show you how long it's been around. Right? Forever.
>> Estelle Weyl: It's been around forever and it's still prefixed.
>> Estelle Weyl: It's not even looking like it's gonna lose its prefix anytime soon.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so let me just reload this page.

[00:05:49]
Okay, so the border-image, the underlying properties are the border-image-source, the slice, the width, the outset, and the repeat. And that's for the border-image is actually the shorthand.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay? So unlike background image, which is a long hand property, border image is a short hand property.
>> Estelle Weyl: For it to work, you actually have to have a border, cuz you have to have that width of that border to say how wide you want your image to be.

[00:06:29]
So here I have a really ugly image.
>> Estelle Weyl: And I am stretching it and I am repeating it and I'm rounding it.
>> Estelle Weyl: And I think repeat or stretch will look the best, okay, that looks good. So I have a background image that looks like a tiny version of this.

[00:07:05]
So why would I wanna use border-image? Because I might want to use this image 150,000 different sizes. But I always want those corners to be the exact same. And then I like it to stretch in between. So that would be a use case of not making 150 different sizes of this image.

[00:07:26]
I could also just put background cover, right? But if I take it and I make it background cover and I have something that's 500 pixels wide, those corners on the edge are gonna stretch and I don't want that. So that would be a use case for border-image. So here I'm stretching it cuz it's a gradient and I want it to look tall.

[00:07:49]
If I repeated it in the middle, I'm repeating that gradient and that doesn't look good.
>> Estelle Weyl: If I was doing a stamp, if I had a picture of a stamp, all I would have to do is do one repetition of the stamp. And then I could actually make that stamp repeat 100 times.

[00:08:07]
Cuz you know how stamps go have a straight edge or they used to before they were stickers. Now I think they're just rectangular, I'm not sure. I don't even know the last time I used a stamp was, cuz I don't know the last time I paid a bill.

[00:08:19]
No, I pay all my bills online, so I'm very happy to have my bank pay for the stamps. Because they certainly don't give me interest on my money. Okay, so I have these properties. Basically, the border-image-source is the first one I declare, which is the gradient image that I used.

[00:08:40]
The border-image-slice is up to four values. And I'm gonna show you in the next picture a little bit better how it's explained. And then I have a border-image-width which is going to be basically the same size as the width of my border.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then I repeated, round it or stretch it and I can't remember what the outset is cuz I didn't use it, I don't think I need it.

[00:09:08]

>> Estelle Weyl: Yeah, I didn't use it. Okay, so here we have a very long cat.
>> Estelle Weyl: Right there is basically width of the border is. You see the border width is 48 by 137 by 68 by 84 and in my border image I repeat that as 48 137 68 84 without the pixel units.

[00:09:35]
Then I can use the property of fill to fill it or not fill it. And my cat looks better filled.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then I stretch it, because if I repeat,
>> Estelle Weyl: It looks really weird.
>> Estelle Weyl: So I stretch it. So what I'd like you to do is just take two minutes to change the border sizes to play with basically both these screens.

[00:10:13]

>> Estelle Weyl: So you have a little bit of an understanding. This is actually the produced syntax right here, so you can switch these.
>> Estelle Weyl: And the URL is gradient, so letâ€™s see if I can find, while you do that, I'm gonna find the URL of this image.
>> Estelle Weyl: So you see I used the style here, right here, and I told you yesterday to not use style.

[00:10:47]
The reason I'm doing that is because I'm actually doing sliders and I'm dynamically reloading the page. So it's my JavaScript that's doing it. I would not do this in production but this is an example as to how to show you how to do this. There is so much bad and evil code, I'd say it's embarrassing.

[00:11:06]
But I don't get embarrased. So this is the original image that we stretched, okay? So that's what you're stretching. What you wanna do is you wanna repreat this inner part but you wanna maintain these little corners on the outside. So how big
>> Estelle Weyl: Does your gradient have to be.

[00:11:29]
So let's actually go over here. Oops. And change this from longcat, if you want to. You don't have to. And do that.
>> Estelle Weyl: So now I just have the four corners except for I really wanna have about 10 pixels by 10 pixels by 10 pixels by 10 pixels.

[00:11:57]
Is that enough? Yeah.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then my old syntax, cuz I have to look at things, cuz I don't know this by heart.
>> Estelle Weyl: Is,
>> Estelle Weyl: No, stretch.
>> Estelle Weyl: And,
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay. So let's just copy this over here.
>> Estelle Weyl: I'm gonna hit Return right here cuz you can actually have things that are two lines long and just do this.

[00:12:47]

>> Estelle Weyl: So why does it not have this stuff in the middle? Because I need to fill it.
>> Estelle Weyl: And where do I put the fill?
>> Estelle Weyl: I don't remember.
>> Speaker 2: After the image URL.
>> Estelle Weyl: There we go. And let me do 30,
>> Estelle Weyl: 30. I hope you're playing along cuz I don't have to come all the way to Minnesota to play with this, I can do this at home.

[00:13:32]
Okay. And width, 60 pixels. Height, 80 pixels.
>> Estelle Weyl: Box-sizing
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay. So now it's 60 pixels by 80 pixels.
>> Estelle Weyl: Why don't we make the width 160?
>> Estelle Weyl: 40 and then just do 20, 20, 20, 20. So you see how I can make that image in no matter what size I make it, it still looks ugly.

[00:14:25]
No matter what size I make it, it still looks like it was the original image of the button. It's doesn't look like I completely played around with that and stretched it. So that's border-image. One last thing I want to cover on border-image, which I didn't cover before, is how the border-image is placed.

[00:14:45]
Basically, when you were just defining the widths of the borders, you were defining what was on the left, what was on the top, what was on the right, and what was on the bottom. And then you were placing or slicing the background, that border-image, into nine parts. The upper right hand part was put in the upper right hand corner.

[00:15:07]
The upper left hand part was put in the upper left hand corner. The bottom right hand part was put in the bottom right hand corner. And the bottom left hand part was put in the bottom left hand corner. And then the rest of it was stretched or repeated.

[00:15:19]
So this is kind of like just an image to indicate what was going on. You're placing the four corners, so when you have a background image, you kinda need to know what areas you wanna maintain the exact correct aspect ratio. And then what part you either wanna repeat or you wanna stretch.
