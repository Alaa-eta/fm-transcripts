[00:00:02]
>> Estelle Weyl: So, let's talk about border radius. In the upper right-hand corner, we have border radius is zero, which is the default. I've put it two different colors on it, so that you could see where the angles are. And when we learn how to make triangles, or looked at making triangles yesterday with generated content, that was the power of, we can actually use those angles.

[00:00:24]
The thing is, when you're doing border radius, you start getting kind of funky looking stuff. Like the border radius of 20 pixels and the border radius of 50 pixels, it's just a little bit weird. So do not prefix border radius. I see moz-border-radius in so many different things, and I think it's been supported since Firefox 3.6.

[00:00:48]
Who here still supporting Firefox 3.6, right? So why do I see moz-border-radius all over the place. You also don't want to use web kit border radius, because even though android 2.3 still needs it, it slows the device down. So a person's already on a crappy device and you're making their life worse.

[00:01:10]
So, don't ever prefix this, and I believe like last year on the SAS homepage, where it was showing you how to use functions, it actually expanded using anti moz-border-radius radius. And I'm kind of like please. So when you're using pre-processors or post-processors make sure you're not adding when you don't need it.

[00:01:32]
Okay, so, to make a circle you need to have an element that has the same height and width, otherwise it's going to be an ellipse. But if you want to make an ellipse or a circle, and a circle is a type of ellipse, just use boarder radius 50%.

[00:01:45]
If you put two values, it's different than putting two values with a slash. So, in the third example we have boarder-radius 10 pixels, 30 pixels. Which means the upper left-hand corner and the bottom right-hand corner have a border radius of 10 pixels. And the upper right-hand corner and the lower left-hand corner have a radius of 30 pixels.

[00:02:12]
Which is much prettier than the thing we are doing next, which is 10 pixels / 30 pixels. That's basically saying horizontally make the border radius 30 pixels and vertically make it 10 pixels or the other way around. And than we can do really ugly stuff cuz we can put all four values, the bottom one that's ugly, it's called uglification, and it's something we're learning a lot about today.

[00:02:45]
That's how to make an ugly thing
>> Estelle Weyl: on the web. So that's saying basically, the upper left hand is 10 pixels by 30 pixels. The upper right is 35 by 35, the bottom right is 20 by 5, and the bottom left is 15 by 5, and that's just ugly.

[00:03:10]
But you can do that, so just realize that that's what boarder-radius is doing. So let's just play with border-radius for 45 seconds and try to make this as ugly as possible. Another thing to note on this, as you're making this ugly is, you see the original corner would have been here, and that's where this is going.

[00:03:29]
It's going to that mark right there, so it's actually cutting off. It's on the bottom edge, because your border-radius will curve in, but your colors will stay angled. And if you just get rid of the slash that's actually not ugly anymore. The slash is in the syntax, and now that you know it, let's see we even use it anywhere.

[00:04:12]

>> Estelle Weyl: Now all the examples with slashes are ugly. And the thing is, if you're going to use the shorthand, or the longhand of a border.
>> Estelle Weyl: There is a top left radius, top right, yeah. So, if I want to make this ugly, I actually just do 40% or 20%.

[00:04:42]
Right, that's ugly, but when I have two different values, a different value for vertical than for horizontal. So the vertical is 20 pixels and the horizontal is 50%, there's no slash. So there's only slash in the longhand, not in the shorthands.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, let's go on to border images.

[00:05:07]
So what is a border image?
>> Estelle Weyl: Or how is it supported?
>> Estelle Weyl: Considering it's been around, let's just show you how long it's been around, right? Forever, oops, it's been around forever and it's still prefixed.
>> Estelle Weyl: It's not even looking like it's going to lose its prefix anytime soon.

[00:05:45]
Okay, so let me just reload this page. Okay, so the border image, the underlying properties are the border image source, the slice, the width, the outset, and the repeat. And that's for the border image is actually the shorthand, okay? So unlike background image, which is a longhand property, border image is a shorthand property.

[00:06:21]
For it to work, you actually have to have a border, cuz you have to have that width of that border to say how wide you want your image to be. So, here I have a really ugly image.
>> Estelle Weyl: And I am stretching it, and I am repeating it, and I'm rounding it.

[00:06:56]
And I think repeat or stretch will look the best, okay that looks good. So I have a background image that looks like a tiny version of this. So why would I want to use a border image? Because I might want to use this image 150,000 different sizes, but I always want those corners to be the exact same, and then I like it to stretch in between.

[00:07:19]
So, that would be a use case of not making a 150 different sizes of this image. I could also just put background cover, right? But if I take it and I make a background cover, and I have something that's 500 pixels wide, those corners on the edge are gonna stretch, and I don't want that.

[00:07:41]
So that will be a used case for border image. So here I'm stretching it, cuz it's a gradient and I want to look tall. If I repeated it In the middle I'm repeating that gradient and that doesn't look good. If I was doing a stamp, like if I had a picture of a stamp, all I would have to do is one repetition of that stamp, and then I could actually make that stamp repeat 100 times.

[00:08:06]
Cuz you know how stamps go, they have a straight edge, or they used to before they were stickers, now I think they're just rectangular, I'm not sure. I don't even know the last time I used a stamp was because I don't know the last time I paid a bill.

[00:08:19]
No I pay all of my bills online so I'm very happy to have my bank pay for the stamps, because they certainly don't give me interest on my money. Okay so, I have these properties. Basically, the border-image-source is the first one I declare which is the gradient image that I used.

[00:08:40]
The border-image-slice is up to four values, and I'm gonna show you in the next picture a little bit better how it's explained. And then I have border-image-width, which is going to be basically the same size as the width of my border.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then I repeat it, round it or stretch it, and I can't remember what the outset is cuz I didn't use it, I don't think I need it.

[00:09:08]
Yeah, I didn't use it, okay so here we have a very long cat. Right there is basically what the border is, you see the border width is 48 by 137 by 68 by 84. And in my border image I repeat that as 48, 137, 68, 84, without the pixel units.

[00:09:35]
Then I can use the property of fill to fill it or not fill it, and my cat looks better filled.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then I stretch it, because if I repeat
>> Estelle Weyl: It looks really weird,
>> Estelle Weyl: So I stretch it. So, what I would like you to do is just take two minutes to change the border sizes, to play with basically both of these screens.

[00:10:14]
So you have a little bit of an understanding, this is actually the produced syntax right here. So you can switch these
>> Estelle Weyl: And the URL is gradient, so let's see if I can find. While you do that, I'm gonna find the URL of this image.
>> Estelle Weyl: So you see I used the style here, right here, and I told you yesterday to not use style.

[00:10:47]
The reason I'm doing that is because I'm actually doing sliders and I'm dynamically reloading the page, so it's my Java script that's doing it. I would not do this in production, but this is an example as to show you how to do this. There's so much bad and evil code, I'd say it's embarrassing, but I don't get embarrassed.

[00:11:07]
So this is the original image that we stretched, okay? So that's what you're stretching. What you wanna do is you wanna repeat this inner part, but you wanna maintain these little corners on the outside. So how big
>> Estelle Weyl: does your gradient have to be. So let's actually go over here, oops, and change this from longcat, if you want to, you don't have to, and do that.

[00:11:44]

>> Estelle Weyl: So now I just have the four corners, except for I really wanna have about 10px, by 10px, by 10px, by 10px, is that enough? Yeah, and then my old syntax, cuz I have to look at things, cuz I don't know this by heart
>> Estelle Weyl: Is, no, stretch.

[00:12:29]

>> Estelle Weyl: And, okay, so let's just copy this over here. I'm going to hit return right here, cuz you can actually have things that are two lines long, and just do this. So why does it not have the stuff in the middle? Because I need to fill it.
>> Estelle Weyl: And where do I put the fill?

[00:12:58]
I don't remember.
>> Speaker 2: After the image URL.
>> Estelle Weyl: There we go, and let me do a 30.
>> Estelle Weyl: 30, I hope you're playing along, cuz I don't have to come all the way to Minnesota to play with this, I can do this at home.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, and width,

[00:13:38]

>> Estelle Weyl: 60 pixels, height, 80 pixels.
>> Estelle Weyl: Box sizing,
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so now it's 60 pixels by 80 pixels.
>> Estelle Weyl: Why don't we make the width 160, 40, and then just do 20, 20, 20, 20? So you see how I can make that image and no matter what size I make it, it still looks ugly?

[00:14:25]
I mean, no matter what size I make it, it still looks like it was the original image of the button? It doesn't look like I completely played around with that and stretched it. So that's border image, one last thing I want to cover on border image which I didn't covered before is how the border image is placed.

[00:14:45]
Basically, when you are just defining the widths of the borders you're defining what was on the left, what was on the top, what was on the right, and what was on the bottom. And then you're replacing, or slicing, the background, that border image, into nine parts. The upper right-hand part was put in the upper right-hand corner, the upper left-hand part was put in the upper left-hand corner.

[00:15:10]
The bottom right-hand part was put in the bottom right-hand corner, and the bottom left-hand part was put in the bottom left-hand corner. And then the rest of it was stretched or repeated. So this is kind of like just an image to indicate what was going on, you're placing the four corners.

[00:15:24]
So when you have a background image, you kind of need to know what areas you want to maintain the exact correct aspect ratio. And then what part you either want to repeat or you want to stretch.
