00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
let's take a look at perspective.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.230
There's two ways to declare perspective.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.140
Either you can declare
it as the first value,

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.860
the first function of
the transform property.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.680
If it's not the first,
it doesn't do anything, okay?

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.950
So you always wanna start with perspective
if you're doing 3D transforms and

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.546
you're gonna include perspective.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.933
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So perspective, you can
put the perspective property itself on

9
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.623
an individual element or on the parent.

10
00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:37.103
And the difference between putting it on
an individual element versus on the parent

11
00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:41.519
is if you put it on the parent, all of its
children will have the same perspective,

12
00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.441
so they'll all go out or whatever.

13
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:46.518
And if you put it on each individual one,
each will look the exact same.

14
00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:50.592
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll show you
an example of that, I think.

15
00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:54.587
So here, we have a perspective of 40.

16
00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:59.393
You can also have a perspective of 400,
or a 4.

17
00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.506
And 4 is gonna look crazy.

18
00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:07.822
Oops,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right?.

19
00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:11.962
The smaller the number,
it's basically this is 4 pixels for

20
00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:16.320
my eyeball, and
this is 40 pixels for my eyeball.

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870
And this is 400 pixels for my eyeball.

22
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.666
And so if we rotate it 80 degrees,
right, and

23
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:28.287
then we do 40, it's basically,

24
00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:34.096
I have this piece of paper right
here that says RSVP on it.

25
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.514
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, remember that the
perspective function must come first and

26
00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:44.690
that smaller numbers are basically closer
to your eye and have a bigger impact.

27
00:01:47.453 --> 00:01:51.410
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So here,
I put the perspective on the parent.

28
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.579
And it looks almost the same right?

29
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.250
Doesn't make much of a difference
when there's one, but

30
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.360
you can really see it when you have
multiple elements, and here is that.

31
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.650
You see here, the perspective of
400 pixels is put on the child,

32
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.363
and these 3 look identical.

33
00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:17.590
Whereas here I put 400 pixels on the
parent, and you're basically looking at it

34
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.490
from here, and so all of them
are basically angling to the same point.

35
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.170
So you'll generally, if you have one
element, just put it on the child.

36
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.970
If you have multiple elements and
you're doing a city scene or

37
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.440
something like that,
put it on the parent of the whole thing.

38
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.070
Okay, next we're gonna
cover perspective-origin.

39
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.464
So right now, we've been basically
staring at it dead center.

40
00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:42.240
Perspective-origin, you
can give it an x or

41
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.995
a y, and it's basically where the viewer
appears to be looking at the child.

42
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:51.830
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
here I have two of them.

43
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.932
I have a perspective from the top left,
and perspective from the top right.

44
00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:03.885
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So each one of these has
perspective of 100, let's make it 60.

45
00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.465
Make it more obnoxious.

46
00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:09.650
Let's make it 120, so
it's more reasonable.

47
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.725
So this is number one, and
this is number two, I believe, right?

48
00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:21.163
Okay, yeah.

49
00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:24.497
And this is center,

50
00:03:24.497 --> 00:03:29.210
default to center, right?

51
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.620
Top right.

52
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.769
So, let's just look at this.

53
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.680
So, one of them is top right.

54
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.320
And the other one is just right.

55
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.920
Let's do center right.

56
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.620
It's not that much of a difference,

57
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.650
you can play around with it until
you figure out what you like.

58
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.520
Just realize,

59
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.840
this is perspective origin, you can
actually say, I'm looking at it from here.

60
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.780
I'm looking at it from there.

61
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.280
Perspective origin only works if
the perspective is on the parents.

62
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.970
Here's on the child and
had no impact whatsoever.

63
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.870
If you look at this in the previous one,
same thing.

64
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.360
So here,
I'm looking at it from over to the right.

65
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.566
That's perspective origin.

66
00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:25.550
Transform-origin is something
you're gonna use all the time,

67
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.260
and it doesn't have to be a 3D element.

68
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.602
So basically it's where, when you rotate
something or you're rotating right now,

69
00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:36.840
it's by default,
it's the center of that element.

70
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.810
But you could also make
it the upper corner or

71
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.896
you could make it
somewhere completely else.

72
00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:45.933
So here,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I

73
00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.337
don't like that example.

74
00:04:48.337 --> 00:04:50.210
Okay, so this a better example.

75
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.390
Here the transform origin property
is in the upper left hand corner.

76
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.679
It is rotating around
this mark right there.

77
00:04:57.966 --> 00:05:00.440
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: 120, right?

78
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.772
So no matter where I do it, that top
corner is always gonna be touching.

79
00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:15.815
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right,
you see how it's always touching?

80
00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:19.181
320, it's always touching.

81
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:21.586
Now, let's do bottom,

82
00:05:25.056 --> 00:05:29.180
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Oop, bottom right.

83
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.060
So this corner right
here is always touching.

84
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.970
It looks like it's not touching cuz
these shadows are overlapping, but

85
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.790
that little corner right there,
it's on top of it.

86
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.471
So, 120, 220, 320, and

87
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:47.212
then 420 because 420 is a cool number.
