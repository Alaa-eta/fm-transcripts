00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.380
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So
let's take a look at perspective.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.230
There's two ways to declare perspective.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.140
Either you can declare
it as the first value,

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.860
the first function of
the transform property.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.510
If it's not the first,
it doesn't do anything, okay?

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.952
So you always wanna start with perspective
if you're doing 3D transforms and

7
00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:27.204
you're gonna include perspective.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So perspective, you

8
00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:33.000
can put the perspective property itself on
an individual element or on the parent.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.410
And the difference between putting it on
an individual element versus the parent is

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.631
if you put it on the parent, all of its
children will have the same perspective,

11
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:43.536
so they'll all go out or whatever.

12
00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:45.162
If you put it on each individual one,

13
00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:50.053
each will look the exact same.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I'll show you an example of

14
00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:50.830
that, I think.

15
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.900
So here, we have a perspective of 40.

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.399
We can also have a perspective of 400.

17
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.056
Or a 4, and 4 is gonna look crazy, oops.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Right,

18
00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:11.850
the smaller the number, it's basically
just four pixels from my eyeball.

19
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.320
And this is 40 pixels from my eyeball.

20
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870
And this is 400 pixels from my eyeball.

21
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.460
And so if we rotate it 80 degrees, right?

22
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.221
And then we do 40, it's basically,
I had this piece of paper right

23
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:37.753
here that says RSVP on it.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

24
00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:40.770
remember that the perspective
function must come first, and

25
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.496
that smaller members are basically
close to your eye and

26
00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:47.676
will have a bigger impact.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

27
00:01:47.676 --> 00:01:53.849
here I put the perspective on the parent.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

28
00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:55.579
it looks almost the same, right?

29
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.250
Doesn't make much of a difference
when there's one, but

30
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.360
you can really see it when
you have multiple elements.

31
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.360
And here is that.

32
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.650
We see here, the perspective of
400 pixels is put on the child,

33
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.100
and these three look identical.

34
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.590
Whereas, here up at 400 pixels on the
parent, and you're basically looking at it

35
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.490
from here, and so it's, all of them
are basically angling to the same point.

36
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.170
So you'll generally, if you have one
element, just put it on the child.

37
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.970
If you have multiple elements and
you're doing a city scene or

38
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.440
something like that,
put it on the parent of the whole thing.

39
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.070
Okay, next we're gonna
cover perspective origin.

40
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.718
So right now, we've been basically
staring at it dead center.

41
00:02:40.718 --> 00:02:44.234
Perspective-origin, you
can give it an x or a y.

42
00:02:44.234 --> 00:02:47.000
And it's basically where the viewer
appears to be looking at the child.

43
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.205
So here I have two of them.

44
00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.241
I have a perspective from the top left,
and

45
00:02:54.241 --> 00:03:00.341
a perspective from the top right.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

46
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:06.000
each one of these has perspective of 100,
let's make it 60, make it more obnoxious.

47
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.738
Let's make it 120, so

48
00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:12.412
it's more reasonable.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

49
00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:15.907
this is number one, and
this is number two I believe.

50
00:03:19.902 --> 00:03:23.500
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Right, okay, yeah.

51
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.479
And this is center, default is center,

52
00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.468
right,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Top

53
00:03:29.468 --> 00:03:34.769
right,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So let's just look at this.

54
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.320
So one of them is top right,
the other one is just right.

55
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.920
Let's do center right.

56
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.770
Not that much of a difference.

57
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.650
Play around with it until you
figure out what you like.

58
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.150
Just realize this is perspective-origin.

59
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.780
You can actually say, I'm looking at
from here, I'm looking at it from there.

60
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.280
Perspective origin only works if
the perspective is on the parent.

61
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.970
Here it's on the child, and
it has no impact whatsoever.

62
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.870
If you look at this,
then the previous one, the same thing.

63
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.257
So here I'm looking at
from over to the right.

64
00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:19.591
That's perspective-origin.

65
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:25.573
Transform-origin is something
you're gonna use all the time,

66
00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:29.280
and it doesn't have to be a 3D element.

67
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.894
So basically it's,
when you rotate something and

68
00:04:31.894 --> 00:04:36.840
you are rotating it right now, it's by
default, it's the center of that element.

69
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.930
But you could also make
it in the upper corner or

70
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.790
you can make it somewhere completely else.

71
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.940
So here, I don't like that example.

72
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.210
Okay, so this is a better example.

73
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.390
Here, the transform origin property
is in the upper left hand corner.

74
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.741
It is rotating around
this mark right there.

75
00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:00.440
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 120, right?

76
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.102
So no matter where I do it,
that top corner is always gonna be

77
00:05:04.102 --> 00:05:12.870
touching.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Right,

78
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.850
you see how it's always touching?

79
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.060
320.

80
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.610
It's always touching.

81
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:27.080
Now let's do bottom, oop, bottom right.

82
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.060
So if this corner right
here is always touching.

83
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.860
It looks like it's not touching
cuz these shadows are overlapping.

84
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.630
But that little corner right there.

85
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.790
It's on top of it.

86
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.451
So 120, 220, 320, and

87
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:47.248
then 420, cuz 420 is a cool number.
