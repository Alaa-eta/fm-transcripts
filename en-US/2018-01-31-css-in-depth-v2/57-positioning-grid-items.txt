>> Estelle Weyl: So let's go onto the next feature which is placement, of placing a grid item. So earlier I talked about the grid lines and the grid lines are in red and the grid items are in blue. So if you see, I have a 3x3 grid but I have 4 grid lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 across and down.

[00:00:22]
So when I place an item, I say basically, at which grid line does it start and at which grid line does it end? Both in the direction of the row and the column. So I have four properties for that or several, even more than four properties. I can say, my item grid row starts at two.

[00:00:42]
So it starts at the second line and it ends at the fourth row grid line. And it starts at the column start of the second grid line which is right in front of the second column and it ends at the fifth column line which is after the fourth column.

[00:01:02]

>> Estelle Weyl: There's actually shorthand for grid-row-start and grid-row-end, which is just grid-row. So you put the number and then you put a slash.
>> Estelle Weyl: And then there's also a shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end, which is just grid-column: 2 / 5. So the grid-column-start / grid-column-end. And then I could do shorthand and basically say grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-end.

[00:01:40]
And I hope you all memorized that, it's a little bit complex. But just remember, it goes start, start, end, end.
>> Estelle Weyl: And I should have a slide somewhere where it actually says, a little bit later, I elaborate if you have fewer than four values. I should have put it right here but apparently I didn't because I wanted to play with it right away.

[00:02:02]
So let's play with this right away. Here I have grid-row-start at 2, grid-row-end at 4. So it's starting at the second line, third line, fourth line. So it's going from 2 to 4. So those are the rows that it goes through. And then it says which columns is it going through?

[00:02:21]
It's starting at the second column line and it goes through the fifth. I could do,
>> Estelle Weyl: And that's the exact same thing, right? And I could do grid-column, 2/5 and that's the same thing. Now if I wanna do just grid,
>> Estelle Weyl: Area,
>> Estelle Weyl: That's not what we want, we actually want 2 and 5.

[00:03:06]
And that brings it back to the same thing, because it was,
>> Estelle Weyl: It's grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-end.
