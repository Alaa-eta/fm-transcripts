>> Estelle Weyl: So, let's go on to the next feature, which is placement, placing a grid item. So, earlier, I talked about the grid lines. And the grid lines are in red, and the grid items are in blue. So if you see, I have a three by three grid, but I have four grid lines, one, two, three, and four.

[00:00:20]
Across and down.
>> Estelle Weyl: So when I place an item, I say basically, at which grid line does it start, and at which grid line does it end, both in the direction of the row and the column? So I have four properties for that, or several, even more than four properties.

[00:00:39]
I can say my item grid rows start at two. So it starts at the second line, and it ends at the fourth row grid line. And it starts at the column start of the second grid line, which is right in front of the second column, and it ends at the fifth column line, which is after the fourth column.

[00:01:02]

>> Estelle Weyl: There is actually shorthand for grid-row-start and grid-row-end, which is just grid-row. So you put the number, and then you put a slash. And then there's also a shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end, which is just grid-column 2 /5. So it's grid-column-start, slash, grid-column-end. And then I could do shorthand, and basically say grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-end, and I hope you all memorize that.

[00:01:42]
It's a little bit complex, but just remember, it goes start, start, and end. And I should have a slide somewhere, where it actually says, a little bit later, I elaborate if you have fewer than four values. I should have put it right here, but, apparently, I didn't. Because I want to play with it right away.

[00:02:02]
So let´s play with this right away. Here I have grid row start at 2, grid-row-end at 4. So it´s starting at the second line, third line, fourth line. So it's going from two to four. So those are the rows that it goes through. And then it says, which columns is it going through?

[00:02:21]
It's starting at the second column line, and it goes to the fifth. I could do
>> Estelle Weyl: and that's the exact same thing, all right? And I could do grid-column 2 / 5.
>> Estelle Weyl: And that's the same thing. Now, if I wanna do just grid
>> Estelle Weyl: Area.
>> Estelle Weyl: That's not what we want.

[00:03:00]
We actually want 2 and 5. And that brings it back to the same thing. Because it was,
>> Estelle Weyl: It's grid-row start, grid-column start, grid rows end, grid column end.
