[00:00:01]
>> Estelle Weyl: The thing with a lot of icons, this is kind of one of the features and I thought this was the best place to talk about it, cuz using this user generated content is actually a really good way to do it. So there's a lot of icons that are completely not accessible.

[00:00:15]
So if I put the snowman, remember that snowman 2603? It doesn't say snowman, when you're using assistive technology. So Google came out with these material icons, and you can tell that Google does not hire enough diversity because there is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight airplane seats in the material icons and no pregnant women.

[00:00:46]

>> Estelle Weyl: I don't know. Okay, they need a little bit more diversity at Google but they are never going to get it while they still have the same hiring practices. That was another opinionated comment. So what is material icons? If I actually were to do a view source inspect on this, I would see a bunch of words.

[00:01:09]
And so it'd be airplane_seat_flat, airplane_seat_angled, airplane_seat_individual_suite because who here as ever been able to get an individual suite on a plane? This is not a material icon that I ever need to use, extra legroom, I pay still for that, legroom_normal, legroom_reduced, that's me, seat_recline, that a person in front of you that you wanna punch.

[00:01:34]
Okay, so these are words. These the screen reader will read, right? So what they did is they use ligatures. Have you ever seen an f with an i and then outside of the f goes to the top of the i? That's a ligature. So basically they use ligatures to say basically when you have the word, airplane suite, which one's a suite?

[00:01:56]
This one?
>> Estelle Weyl: That is so not worth $10,000 for one line. So basically, what I did here is I have a class of material-icons. It starts with material-icons, so I can just add a dash and something else afterwards. Margins, I'm using marterial icon's font. And then I have antialiased and feature-settings on liga.

[00:02:25]
So, I'm not going to cover fonts in depth but just realize that these are properties like anti-aliased and font feature settings you can use, like liga. So these are something you wanna look up. And then with the generated content, actually, here I'm not even using generated content, I'm just using the word face.

[00:02:49]
So it's saying, when I have this font, the ligature of f, a, c and e combined, produces this.
>> Estelle Weyl: So here it's generated content. Here I have the black one is material icons and the word is accessibility and I have an accessibility icon. So the screen reader would read accessibility.

[00:03:12]
The sighted user would actually see the icon. And you generally don't actually wanna do this because a lot of people don't understand what this icon means. So a sighted user might not know that this means accessibility, right? But if I change this just to show you that it works.

[00:03:32]
Face, you see I typed in face, and we get a face. So, there's like a thousand of these that you can use. You just have to call in the material icon's font.
>> Estelle Weyl: So, this is one thing you can use with generated content. The other interesting thing is, there is also UTF for browsers that don't support ligatures and those font features, you can actually use the \e84e.

[00:04:08]
The only thing is, if I do this in a browser that doesn't support it, what happens? If this browser doesn't support the ligature of face, what would be written on the bottom? The word face because the cascade overwrote the \e84e. So it would actually say the word face.

[00:04:32]
So later on, we're going to discuss how you can actually feature detect whether the browser supports,
>> Estelle Weyl: This feature, which is needed, right? And then you can use, in that support query, you can just put that feature, okay. So, accessibility.
>> Estelle Weyl: Actually what you would wanna do in this case, I just thought of the right solution for this is, you only call this font, the material icons font, if the ligature is supported otherwise you'd get face.

[00:05:15]
That would be the best way to do it. Instead of doing this, this would be stupid, just basically serve the word face to everyone.
>> Estelle Weyl: Or maybe not, nevermind, ignore that. Because then you would get the word face and that might not be what you want. You actually want the icon.

[00:05:35]
Okay, accessibility. I've just been talking a lot about accessibility. But let's go over the actual features. Generated [COUGH] content is actually read by most screen readers, but it should enhance the content, it's progressive enhancement, it should not be relied upon. Because basically generated content is part of the presentation layer.

[00:06:03]
And content is HTML, and we don't want to mix those concerns up. And I'm not just saying you don't want to mix it up and that's a steadfast rule and that's why. But this is just one of the examples of you want the content to actually be on the page if it's important.

[00:06:18]
So you can use these features if you want to improve user experience, but don't make it a requirement of user experience.
>> Estelle Weyl: If you are really into accessibility, the generated content is part of the accessible name computation of, there's an accessibility object model. And it is actually going to be in there if it's not already.

[00:06:47]
And all browsers except for Internet Explorer expose generated content to expose it. And therefore it can be read by the screen user. So in the future right now we just have content, right? We would just say content url question_svg, right? In the future, we'll be able to put a slash and basically a hint as to what it means.

[00:07:20]
Because those icons that I was talking to you about, that face, the side user is like, I have no clue why that face is there. And that bed lining I had no clue that that was on airplane suite because it's not made my daily lexicon. If something is gonna be purely decorative, like 25ba, I have no clue what 25ba, but like the snowman, purely decorative, does not add to the context, you can just put a slash and then empty quotes so that it won't be read to the screen reader.

[00:07:52]
So this is providing more information because there's no way to put an alt attribute on generated content, right? I've had that picture of myself. No screen user would know that that was a picture of me. But I would write and then they would know what they were supposed to be looking at.
