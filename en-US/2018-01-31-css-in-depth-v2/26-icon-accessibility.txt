[00:00:01]
>> Estelle Weyl: The thing with a lot of icons, this is kind of like one of the other features, and I though this was the best place to talk about it, cuz using this as generated content is actually a really good way to do it. So, there's a lot of icons that are completely not accessible.

[00:00:15]
So, if I put the snowman, remember that snowman 2603? It doesn't say snow man when you're using assistive technology. So Google came out with its material icons and you could tell Google does not hire enough diversity. Because there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight airplane seats in a material icons and no pregnant women

[00:00:46]

>> Estelle Weyl: I don't know.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, they need a little bit diversity at Google but they never gonna get it well. They still have the same hiring practices. That was another opinionated comment.
>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
>> Estelle Weyl: So what is material icons? If I actually were to do a view source inspect on this, I would see a bunch of words.

[00:01:10]
And so it would be airplane seat flat, airplane seat angled, airplane seat individual suite. Because who here has ever been able to get individual suite on a plane? This is not a material icon that I ever need to use. Extra legroom, I pay still for that. Legroom normal, legroom reduced, that's me.

[00:01:30]
Seat reclined, that's the person in front of you that you want to punch.
>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so these are words. This is screen reader will read, right? So what they did is they used ligatures. Have you ever seen an F with an I and the outside of the F goes to the top of the I?

[00:01:47]
That's a ligature. So basically they use ligatures to say basically when you have the word airplanes suite, which one is a suite? This one? That is so not worth $10,000 for one [INAUDIBLE]. So basically what I did here is I have a class of material icons. It's such a material icon so I can just add a dash and something else afterwards.

[00:02:18]
Margins using material icons material-icons font and then I have antialiased and feature-settings of liga. So I'm not gonna cover fonts in depth but just realize that these are properties like antialiased and there's font future studies that you can use like liga. So this something you wanna look up if you're [INAUDIBLE] and then with the generated content actually here, I'm not even using generated content I'm just using the word face.

[00:02:49]
So saying when I have this font, the ligature of f a c and e combined produces this.
>> Estelle Weyl: So here it's generated content. Here I have the black one is material-icons and the word is accessibility, and I have an accessibility icon. So the screen reader would read accessibility.

[00:03:12]
The sighted user would actually see the icon and you generally don't actually want to do this, because a lot of people don't understand what the icon means. So a site user might not know that this means accessibility, right?
>> Estelle Weyl: But if I change this just to show you that it works, face, you see that I typed face and we get a face.

[00:03:35]
So there's a thousand of these that you can use. You just have to call in the material icon's font.
>> Estelle Weyl: So this is one thing you can use with generated content. The other interesting thing is there's also UTF. For browsers that don't support ligatures and those font features, you can actually use the \ea4e.

[00:04:07]
The only thing is, if I do this in a browser that doesn't support it, what happens? If the browser doesn't support ligature of face, what would be written on the bottom? The word face because the cascade overwrote the \e84e. So it would actually say the word face. So later along we're going to discuss how you can actually feature the text.

[00:04:36]
Whether the browser supports this feature, which is needed, right? And then you can use in that support query you can just put that feature. Okay, so accessibility. Actually what you would wanted to in this case, I just thought of the right solution for this is. You only call this font, the material icons font if the literature is supported, otherwise you get Face.

[00:05:15]
That would be the best way to do it. Instead of doing this, this would be stupid, just basically serve the word face to everyone.
>> Estelle Weyl: Or maybe not, never mind, ignore that. Because then you would get the word face and that might not be what you want. You actually want the icon.

[00:05:35]
Okay, accessibility. I've just been talking a lot about accessibility but let's go over the actual features. General content is actually read by most screen readers but it should enhance the content. It's progressive enhancement. It should not be the base of your it should not be relied upon.
>> Estelle Weyl: Because basically generated content is part of the presentation layer and content is HTML, and you don't wanna mix those concerns up.

[00:06:08]
And I'm not just saying you don't wanna mix it up and that's a steadfast rule and that's why, but this is just one of the examples of, you want the content to actually be on the page, if it's important. So you can use these features if you want to improve your sort of experience but don't make it a requirement of user experience.

[00:06:30]
If you're really into accessibility, the generated content is part of the accessible name computation of, there's an accessibility object model, and it is actually going to be in there if it's not already. And all browsers except for Internet Explorer expose generated content to the, expose it, and therefore can be read by the screen user.

[00:06:58]
So in the future right now, we have content right? It would say content url(question.svg) right? In the future, we'll be able to put a slash and basically a hint as to what it means, because those icons that I was talking to you about, that face? The site user, it's like I have no clue why that face is there and that bed lying, I had no clue that that was an airplane suite because I It's not in my daily lexicon.

[00:07:36]
It's something that's gonna be purely decorative like 25BA. I have no clue what 25BA but like the snowman purely decorative. Does not add to the content or context. You can just put a slash and then empty quotes so that it won't be read to the screen reader so this providing more information.

[00:07:55]
Because there's no way to put an alt attribute on generated content, right? I've had that picture of myself, no screen reader user would know that that was a picture of me, but I could write cheesy svg still, and they would know what they were supposed to be looking at.
