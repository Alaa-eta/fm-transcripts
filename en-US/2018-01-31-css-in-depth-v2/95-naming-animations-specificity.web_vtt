00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:04.132
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so so
far we've talked about the keyframes but

2
00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:06.400
we haven't actually animated anything.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.590
We've just created the keyframe animation.

4
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.630
We gave it a name and

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.980
that name is what you're going to
use to attach it to an element.

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.817
So the only thing that is required to make
an animation work is the animation name

7
00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:21.065
cuz there are default values for
everything.

8
00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:23.608
So if you recall,
when we overwrote the import,

9
00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:27.032
we just gave it the animation name and
then the keyword forwards.

10
00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:31.394
And I'll talk about forwards but
forwards make stuff stay on the 100% mark.

11
00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:32.383
That's all we did.

12
00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:34.451
And it worked, right?

13
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.299
There was only two properties declared
the name and one other thing.

14
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.750
So we have a base CSS which is our pencil,
the width is 100 pixels,

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.820
the text aligned to the right.

16
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.470
The border bottom is ten pixels
cuz I wanna make it look like it's

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.880
drawing the little border in the bottom.

18
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.994
And then after I put
the pencil a position,

19
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:55.120
absolutely I wanted the pencil
to be lower than it would be.

20
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.200
So that's why I put in the after.

21
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.199
And then I have this keyframe called
drawALine, and it goes from 0 to 100%,

22
00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.214
where the width is 0 and the width is
100%, where it goes from green to blue.

23
00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:09.839
But I didn't attach it to the pencil yet,
right?

24
00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:11.550
The pencil doesn't have any animation.

25
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.070
So let's attach the animation.

26
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.840
I say animation drawALine and
duration three seconds.

27
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.240
If there is no duration, it's zero
seconds and it's kind of a mood point.

28
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.350
So here's going from green to blue
over three seconds, for six seconds.

29
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.960
Wanna see that again?

30
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.760
Let's make it faster so
we're not this annoyed.

31
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.789
Over three seconds.

32
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.195
So I gave it the animation name and
duration, by default,

33
00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:40.812
it only happens once.

34
00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:48.177
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I don't know why
I put this slide in this order but

35
00:01:48.177 --> 00:01:53.916
if you have more than one animation name,
the order of precedence is the one,

36
00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:59.130
it goes in first, that's the first one,
second, and then third.

37
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.511
It's actually blue because the blue
overwrote the background color property

38
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:04.979
for the green and the red.

39
00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.005
So if you have many keyframe animations
with the same property going on at

40
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:13.629
the same time, cuz you can have multiple
animations in an element at the same time.

41
00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.007
Whichever one is declared last,
that will be the property.

42
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:17.452
Okay.

43
00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:24.587
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We already talked about
specificity but in case someone is coming

44
00:02:24.587 --> 00:02:30.974
to this deck without doing the whole deck,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The CSS

45
00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:36.464
can overwrite important, so
just know that animations will work even

46
00:02:36.464 --> 00:02:42.420
if there's a declaration of important
on the property originally.

47
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.510
So here I did say that I want the border
to be black and solid and five pixels.

48
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.666
But because I have a keyframe
animation going on,

49
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:55.429
it's actually changing from red to orange
because the animation right now is active.

50
00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:03.236
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
I already covered this as well.

51
00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:08.629
Do not include important in your
keyframe animations, that will not work.
