00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:04.180
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
far we talked about the keyframes, but

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.400
we haven't actually animated anything.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.590
We've just created the keyframe animation.

4
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.410
We gave it a name,

5
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.980
and that name is what you're going
to use to attach it to an element.

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.870
So the only thing that is required to make
an animation work is the animation name,

7
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.840
cuz there are default values for
everything.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.392
So if you recall,
when we overwrote the important,

9
00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:27.588
we just gave it the animation name and
then the keyword forwards.

10
00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:32.465
And I'll talk about forwards, but forwards
makes stuff stay on the 100% mark.

11
00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.840
That's all we did, we just said,
and it worked, right?

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.270
There was only two properties,
declare their name and one other thing.

13
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.850
So we have a Base CSS,
which is our pencil.

14
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.845
The width is 100 pixels, the text-align to
the right, the border-bottom is 10 pixels,

15
00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.030
cuz I want to make it look like it's
drawing the little border on the bottom.

16
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.060
And then after I put the pencil,
I positioned it absolutely.

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.310
I wanted the pencil to be
lower than it would be, so

18
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.200
that is why I put it in the after.

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.420
And then I have this
keyframe called drawALine.

20
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.366
And it goes from 0 to 100%,
where the width is 0 and

21
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.390
the width is 100%,
where it goes from green to blue.

22
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.190
But I didn't attach it to the pencil yet,
right?

23
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.856
The pencil doesn't have any animation.

24
00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:15.070
So let's attach the animation.

25
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.741
I say animation drawALine and
duration 3 seconds.

26
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:22.240
If there's no duration, it's 0 seconds and
it's kind of a moot point.

27
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.164
So here, it's going from
green to blue over 6 seconds.

28
00:01:28.164 --> 00:01:28.990
Wanna see that again?

29
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.760
Let's make it faster, so
we're not as annoyed.

30
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.789
Over 3 seconds.

31
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.605
So I gave it the animation name and
duration.

32
00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:44.762
By default, it only happens once.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I

33
00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:46.348
don't know why I put
this slide in this order.

34
00:01:46.348 --> 00:01:50.436
But if you have more
than one animation name,

35
00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:54.418
the order of precedence
is the one it goes and

36
00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:58.630
starts the first one,
second and then third.

37
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.810
So it's actually blue,

38
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.440
because the blue overwrote the background
color property for the green and the red.

39
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.562
So if you have many keyframe animations
with the same property going on at

40
00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:13.560
the same time, cuz you can have
multiple animations at the same time.

41
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.171
Whichever one is declared last
that will be the property,

42
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:21.816
okay.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We already talked about

43
00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:22.370
specificity.

44
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.610
But in case someone is
coming to this deck without

45
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.160
doing the whole deck,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: A CSS can

46
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.881
overwrite important.

47
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:37.276
So just know that animations
will work even if there's

48
00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:42.420
a declaration of important
on the property originally.

49
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.386
So here, I did say that I want the border
to be black and solid and 5 pixels.

50
00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:51.600
But because I have keyframe
animation going on,

51
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.218
it's actually changing from red to orange,
because the animation right now is

52
00:02:55.218 --> 00:03:00.598
active.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

53
00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:03.640
I already covered this as well.

54
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.860
Do not include important in
your keyframe animations.

55
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.360
That will not work.
