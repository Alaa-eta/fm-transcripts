00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:05.846
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
another reason to use media queries, or

2
00:00:05.846 --> 00:00:08.660
an interesting thing about media queries,
is SVG.

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.660
Generally, when you say width,
screen and width,

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.760
the width is the device width if
you're on a mobile device or a tablet.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.627
And the browser width,

6
00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:27.239
if you're on a device where you can
just change the size of the browser.

7
00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.137
When it comes to an SVG,
the screen is actually

8
00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:36.165
the width of the container of the SVG.

9
00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:40.948
So if I hit play with this, and right now,

10
00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:45.460
the background, I have a circle SVG and

11
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.955
if I say background is
50% it change colors.

12
00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:58.979
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And 20% it change colors
again, because it's the size of the SVG

13
00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.090
container and the SVG container is
20% of the width of the parent.

14
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.960
And so it's basically saying if
the parent were a 1,000 pixels which,

15
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.512
I know it's more, but I'm just going
to use a 1,000, cuz then I can do math.

16
00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:17.933
So if it was a 1,000 pixels wide,
that would mean when it's 200 pixels wide,

17
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:23.300
it should be green, when it's 300
pixels wide, it should be blue.

18
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.708
When it's 400 pixels wide,
it should be whatever color that is,

19
00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:35.578
whatever color that is,
whatever color that is, and orange.

20
00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:37.440
And [INAUDIBLE] I had 100.

21
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.132
Okay, so let's take

22
00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:49.463
a look at circle.svg.

23
00:01:59.997 --> 00:02:02.661
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay,
and then do a view source.

24
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:11.700
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So here I basically
said if it's under 100 pixels,

25
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.080
make the color badass.

26
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.810
If it's under 300 pixels, I did 300 pixels
twice, this is supposed to be 200 pixels.

27
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.750
506, so
we have these different break points.

28
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.912
And they're not break points decided
on any tablet that I know of,

29
00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:34.399
it's just break points that I
picked because it made sense.

30
00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:41.646
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It

31
00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:48.470
basically says the width and the height
of this SVG is by default 400 pixels.

32
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.197
But that's not what my HTML is saying,
my HTML is saying make it 70%.

33
00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:57.240
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: How did it get this big?

34
00:03:00.182 --> 00:03:01.444
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
what am I gonna do about it?

35
00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:02.602
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You zoomed in.

36
00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:03.412
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No.

37
00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:08.137
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Zero [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But

38
00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:11.221
it didn't actually give me a zero.

39
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:12.850
Okay, thank you.

40
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.030
I didn't actually think I did that.

41
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.970
I'm like all of a sudden,
I didn't know I touched anything.

42
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.140
Okay, so

43
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.220
basically I'm saying the background
size is the container of that SVG.

44
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.820
And I'm just making it 70% of the width,
60% of the width, 100% of the width.

45
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.681
So it's not taking the size of the screen,

46
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:38.578
which is what 99.9% of the time happens,
when it's in SVG,

47
00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:44.817
the min width and max width is actually
the size of the SVG container.
