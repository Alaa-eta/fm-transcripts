00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:06.441
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
another reason to use media queries or

2
00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:10.038
an interesting thing about
media queries is SVG.

3
00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:14.219
Generally, when you say width,
screen and width,

4
00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.970
the width is the device width
if you're on a mobile device or

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.631
tablet, and the browser width,

6
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:27.355
if you're on a device where you can
just change the size of the browser.

7
00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:32.113
When it comes to an SVG,
the screen is actually

8
00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:36.022
the width of the container of the SVG.

9
00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:39.413
So if I hit play with this, and

10
00:00:39.413 --> 00:00:44.854
right now the background,
I have a circle SVG.

11
00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:49.808
And I say background is 50%.

12
00:00:49.808 --> 00:00:51.233
It changed colors.

13
00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:57.892
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
20% it changed colors again.

14
00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:00.699
Because it's the size
of the SVG container.

15
00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.090
And the SVG container is 20%
of the width of the parent.

16
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.225
And so it's basically saying if the parent
were a 1,000 and I know it's more but

17
00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:13.097
I'm just going to use a thousand so
then I can do math.

18
00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:15.298
So if it's 1,000 pixels wide,

19
00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:19.352
that would mean when it's 200 pixels wide,
it should be green.

20
00:01:19.352 --> 00:01:23.296
When it's 300 pixels wide,
it should be blue.

21
00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:30.073
When it's 400 pixels wide,
it should be whatever color that is.

22
00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:34.632
Whatever color that is,
whatever color that is and orange.

23
00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:38.218
9 and 100, okay.

24
00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:42.465
So, let's take a look at circle SVG.

25
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.812
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
and then do a view source.

26
00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:08.381
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here,

27
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:14.322
I basically said if it's under 100
pixels make the color bad ass.

28
00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:18.254
If it's under 300 pixels.

29
00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:21.362
I did 300 pixels twice,
this is supposed to be 200 pixels.

30
00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:24.873
506, so
you have these different break points.

31
00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:29.554
And they're not break points decided
on any tablet that I know of.

32
00:02:29.554 --> 00:02:33.373
It's just break points that I
picked because it made sense.

33
00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:41.737
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It

34
00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:48.389
basically says the width of the height
of this SVG is by default 400 pixels.

35
00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.569
But that's not what my HTML is saying.

36
00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.402
My HTML is saying, make it 70%.

37
00:02:56.086 --> 00:03:00.123
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: How did it get this big?

38
00:03:00.123 --> 00:03:01.421
And what am I going to do about it?

39
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:07.898
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You zoomed in [INAUDIBLE].

40
00:03:07.898 --> 00:03:11.193
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: But I didn't actually.

41
00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:12.684
Okay, thank you.

42
00:03:12.684 --> 00:03:13.928
I didn't actually think I did that.

43
00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:16.854
I'm like all of a sudden,
I didn't know I touched anything.

44
00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:20.193
Okay, so basically I'm saying the size,

45
00:03:20.193 --> 00:03:24.100
the background size is
the container of that SVG.

46
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.542
And I was making it 70% of the width,
60% of the width of the width,

47
00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:28.684
100% of the width.

48
00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:33.786
So it's not taking the size of the screen,

49
00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:41.312
which is what 99.9% of the time
happens when it's in SVG.

50
00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:45.099
The min width and max width is actually
the size of the SVG container.
