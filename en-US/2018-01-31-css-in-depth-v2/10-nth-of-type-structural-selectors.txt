[00:00:05]
>> Estelle Weyl: Let me just go back to here. We tried the first-child, the last-child, the first-of-type, the last-of-type, only-child, and only-of-type. But you can be more specific. You can say the third. You can say every third, so 1, 4, 7, 10, or 2, 5, 8, 11. You can say, there's two key terms, there's odd, and even.

[00:00:30]
But otherwise an equation that is an+b. The b being the offset, and the offset can be negative. And the an, the n is actually the letter n. The a is the variable, and it's basically, what's the incrementer? Or is that right, is that the right word?
>> Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE].

[00:00:54]

>> Estelle Weyl: No, we've been way too long since seventh grade when I learned algebra.
>> Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
>> Estelle Weyl: It is an interval, it's an interval of 3, if we put 3n. But it's something like the increment, whatever. So the letter n, it's not required. Because if you leave out here, we left it out, and it says just the fifth element, right?

[00:01:18]
But if you're going to iterate, then it is the letter n, and there can't be a space, this is wrong, this will not work. That works, okay? So the equation is an+b, which b is the first value where you start counting. So it could be negative 7. And if the incrementer was 3, so it's 3n minus 7.

[00:01:40]
Well there's no negative 4, and there's no negative 1, so we'll really start with 2. But if you had b being 12, so it's 3n +12, it would then be the first item to be targeted, would be number 12. And then it would be number 15, number 18, number 21.

[00:02:02]

>> Estelle Weyl: Hm, we left off the CSS for this one. Now it's like 40, okay. So lets, yeah.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so before we had flexbox, let me see if I can make the flexbox. I'm gonna go like that. Okay, so I'm just gonna go to these two slides until we can catch up, because there is a typo in one of the slides.

[00:02:36]
Okay, so here we have structural selectors. And the first-child, and the last-child, are both bold. We have 10, what number is the first, and the last? 1, and 10. So 1 and 10 are both bold. Then we have the first-of-type, and the last-of-type. The only thing that can be a descendant of an ordered, or unordered list, is an li, so it matches the first-child, and last-child.

[00:03:07]
But it could've been, if we had done paragraphs in H1s, it would've been different. Then we have nth-child(even), background color, gray. And so you'll notice that 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 have a background color of gray. And then it says, nth-child(3). So just the third one, make it gray, as in the color.

[00:03:33]
And so you'll see, all of them are black or blue, except for number 3 is gray. And then it says, nth-of-type(odd), make it white. We'll just make it striped, I could've made it a different color. And then, nth-of-type(4n). So that means every 4th. So it's number 4, number 8, if we had continued, it would've been number 12, number 16, number 20, number 24.

[00:03:58]
So that's 4n. And in the last equation says, 3n-1. So we start with n being 0, and 3n-1 is negative 1, so that doesn't count. Then we say, if n was 1, it would be 3 times 1 is 3, minus 1 is 2. And then if n was 2, it would be 2 times 3, which is 6, minus one is five.

[00:04:24]
Who said you didn't need to know math.
>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
>> Estelle Weyl: Right? So we have number 2, number 5, number 8. And it would have also continued on to number 11, and continued at item of making those aligned right. Do people understand the equation of an+b? Okay, so before we had flexbox, you could do stupid pet tricks like this, which is you could say, the element that is only of its type, give it a width of 100%.

[00:05:04]
So the first element would be the first of its type. And the last of its, nth, last of its type, starting from the end. So here, I'm showing you last-of-type. We have not started from the end before. So nth-last-of-type() says start at the end, and then do the equation.

[00:05:22]
So en element that is both the first of it's type, and the second from the end, means there's exactly two elements. This next line says nth-of-type(2), which means it's the second element, right? And is also the last of it's type, right? That means it's exactly 2, but it's the second one.

[00:05:48]
So make those both 50%. And then going on to the fourth one, it says nth-of-type(1), nth-last-of-type(4). So it's basically saying something that is the first one, and forth from the end, which means it's exactly 4, right? Make it 25%. So this is what we could do before we had flexbox.

[00:06:10]
But later on today, we're gonna cover flexbox. So we don't need to use these stupid pet tricks. But I just did wanna show you that you can put two things together, you can string selectors along like that, okay. So I believe we are back to here, yes. So here, feel free to take two minutes, or three minutes, let's do three minutes, to play with this.
