>> Estelle Weyl: So we've had the, let me just go back to here, we tried the first-child, the last-child, the first-of-type, the last-of-type, only-child and only-of-type. But you can be more specific, you can say the third, you can say every third, so 1, 4, 7, 10, or 2, 5, 8, 11.

[00:00:26]
You can say, there's two key terms, there's odd and even. But otherwise, it's an equation that is an + b, the b being the offset. And the offset can be negative. And the an, the n is actually the letter n. The a is the variable, and it's basically what's the incrementer?

[00:00:50]
Is that right? Is that the right word? No, we've been way too long since seventh grade when I learned algebra. It is an interval. It's an interval of three if we put 3n. It's something like the incrementer, whatever. So letter n is the thing that is, it's not required because if you leave out here, we left it out and so it's just the fifth element, right?

[00:01:18]
But if you're going to iterate, then it is the letter n, and there can't be a space, this is wrong, this will not work, that works, okay? So the equation is an plus b, which b is the first value where you start counting, so it could be negative 7.

[00:01:36]
And if the incrementer was 3 so it's 3n minus 7, well, there's no negative 4 and there's no negative 1, so we really start with 2. But if you had b being 12, so it's 3n plus 12 it would then be the first item to be targeted would be number 12, and it'll be number 15, number 18, number 21.

[00:01:58]

>> Estelle Weyl: So,
>> Estelle Weyl: We left off the CSS for this one, most likely. Okay, so let's,
>> Estelle Weyl: Yeah.
>> Estelle Weyl: Okay, so before we had flexbox, let me see if I can,
>> Estelle Weyl: Make the flexbox,
>> Estelle Weyl: Kinda go like that. Okay, so I'm just gonna go to these two slides until we can catch up, because there's a typo in one of those slides.

[00:02:36]
Okay, so here we have structural selectors. And the first child and the last child are both bold. We have ten, what number is the first and the last? One and ten. So one and ten are both bold. Then we have the first-of-type and the last-of-type because the only thing that can be a descendant of,

[00:03:01]

>> Estelle Weyl: Of an ordered or unordered list is an li. So it matches the first child and last child. But it could have been if we had done paragraphs and h1s, it would have been different. Then we have nth-child even, background-color grey. And so you will notice that 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 have a background color of gray.

[00:03:22]
And then it says, nth-child 3, so just the third one, make it gray.
>> Estelle Weyl: As in the color, and so you'll see all of them are black or blue except for number 3 is gray. And then it says, nth-of-type odd, make it white, which just make it stripe, I could've made it a different color.

[00:03:47]
And then nth-of-type 4n, so that means every 4th. So it's number 4, number 8, if we had continued, it'd have been number 12, number 16, number 20, number 24, so that's 4n. And then the last equation says 3n- 1. So we start with n being 0 and 3n- 1 is negative, so that doesn't count.

[00:04:11]
Then we say if n was 1, it would be 3 times 1 is 3 minus 1 is 2. And then if n was 2, it would be 2 times 3 which is 6 minus 1 is 5. Who said you didn't need to know math, right? So we have number 2, number 5, number 8.

[00:04:30]
And it would have also continued onto number 11. And we can continue to add in some item of making those aligned right. Do people understand the equation of an plus b? Okay.
>> Estelle Weyl: So, before we had flexbox, you could do stupid petrics like these. Which is you could say the element that is only of its type, give it a width of 100%.

[00:05:00]
If you have two elements, so the first element would be the first of its type and the nth last of its type starting from the end. So here I'm showing you last-of-type. We have not started from the end before. So nth-last-of-type, so start at the end and then do the equation.

[00:05:24]
So an element that is both the first of its type and the second from the end, means there's exactly two elements. This next line says nth-of-type 2, which means it's the second element, right? And it's also the last of its type, right?
>> Estelle Weyl: That means it's exactly 2, but it's the second one.

[00:05:47]
So make those both 50%, and then going on to the fourth one, it says nth-of-type 1, nth-last-of-type 4.
>> Estelle Weyl: So it's basically saying something that is the first one and fourth from the end, which means it's exactly 4, right? Make it 25%. So this is what we could do before we had flexbox, but later on today we're going to cover flexbox.

[00:06:12]
So we don't need to use these stupid petrix. But I just did wanna show you that you can put two things together, you can string selectors along like that. Okay, so I believe we are back to here. Yes, so here feel free to take two minutes or three minutes, let's do three minutes, to play with this.
