>> Kyle Simpson: How do you feel so far about this process of asking these questions of bam and where foo is? Are you feeling a little bit more confident? Let's test that out. For those of you that are here in person, I want you to actually find somebody sitting next to you, or get up and walk around.

[00:00:18]
What you're gonna do is you're gonna go through this role play. You're gonna walk through those steps, we'll go back a slide and do it without the [INAUDIBLE] mode. On this slide you're gonna go through and one of you will play the scope manager, and the other one of you will play the compiler, and then swap.

[00:00:35]
And then, also goes to the run time and do both roles. Okay. And do it exactly like I just said. Hey, global scope I have this LHS for foo I haven't heard it, do that exact thing even though it sounds silly we need to make sure that you fully get it.

[00:00:49]
And if there are questions that arise, which they're generally always are, feel free to raise your hand and ask questions. I'm gonna give you about three, or four minutes to just play around with that, so find somebody. If you're online, find somebody that's in the chat room to pair up with and do it over an IM, or something like that.

[00:01:06]
If you're watching this video at a later time, go find a coworker and do the exercise with them, okay? But actually do this, because this is how you get that ingrained, that instinct of how the Lexical Scope works, all right? We'll take a few minutes, let you practice that, and then we'll come back.
