00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.830
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What questions came
up as a result of going through it

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.320
with your neighbor, anything?

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.307
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So we were having a back and
forth on line 8 and 9 about whether foo

4
00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:15.039
got dealt with at compile time or
was left to the second phase.

5
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.864
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay,
the foo on line 8 is the question?

6
00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:19.498
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

7
00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:23.315
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, so the foo on line
8 does get dealt with at compile time,

8
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:27.782
from the perspective of needing to store
that metadata that it is in the lhs

9
00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:29.190
position.

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.407
But foo, on line 8,
is not creating a variable entry,

11
00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:36.937
it's not making a marbel and putting it
in a bucket, that happened on line 7.

12
00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:38.274
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

13
00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:39.679
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So it's kind of both.

14
00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:44.320
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What else?

15
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.446
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is there a good way of
accessing that line 1 from line 4 and

16
00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:50.990
a half?

17
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.893
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: No, the only way to
access it is for a global variable you can

18
00:00:55.893 --> 00:01:00.705
use the cheat that global variables
are properties of the global object.

19
00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:03.368
Which is generally frowned upon,
but if you really needed to,

20
00:01:03.368 --> 00:01:04.530
you could do it that way.

21
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So what's the best
practice and fits the case?

22
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.510
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Well, the best practice
is don't shadow if you're gonna need

23
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.490
access to it.

24
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I'm sorry,
what was the question?

25
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.773
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The question is,
on line 4 and a half,

26
00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.982
is there any way to access
the foo from line 1?

27
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:30.489
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: The foo from line 1 and
then line 4 are those the same marble?

28
00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:31.046
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: No.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Or

29
00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:33.910
are they different marbles in
different scopes, right, yeah.

30
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.974
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The foo from line 1
is a red marble in the red bucket,

31
00:01:36.974 --> 00:01:40.188
the foo from line 4 is a blue
marble in the blue bucket.

32
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.774
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: That's why
we call that shadowing.
