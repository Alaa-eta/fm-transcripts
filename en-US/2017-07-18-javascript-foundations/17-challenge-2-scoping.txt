>> Kyle: Let's check some understanding. What type of scoping rule, or rules, does JavaScript have?
>> Speaker 2: Function scope and lexical scope, right?
>> Kyle: Lexical scope, that's the model, there's only one, function scope is the same thing as lexical scope. Dynamic scope doesn't actually exist in JavaScript, but it does exist in a few esoteric languages.

[00:00:17]
Okay, so there's just lexical scope. What are three different ways that you can create a new scoped variable?
>> Speaker 2: Would a let do?
>> Kyle: You can do a let, that would create a new variable inside of some scope
>> Speaker 3: Var.
>> Kyle: Var inside of a function, like we can make an if e or a function and make a var inside of it.

[00:00:46]

>> Speaker 2: [CROSSTALK]
>> Kyle: Third one is tricky. That's the same thing passing in an argument to an if e.
>> Speaker 4: Function declaration.
>> Kyle: Same thing, we have a parameter list, that's the same thing as a var declaration. How about the catch clause?
>> Speaker 4: Would the, okay.
>> Kyle: The error in a catch clause creates a new variable.

[00:01:07]
Let's review from earlier in the course, what is the difference between undeclared and undefined now that we fully understand lexical scope? What's the difference between undeclared and undefined?
>> Speaker 5: Undeclared it's never been declared.
>> Kyle: It's never been declared in any scope we have access too, exactly. What about undefined?

[00:01:27]

>> Speaker 5: [CROSSTALK] It's been declared.
>> Kyle: It has been declared in a scope, but does not currently have a value, right, does not currently have a value. All right, exercise 2, it's the same one we did earlier when we worked on that work logging application. But now read the Read Me cuz it describes to exactly what to do, don't skip over that detail.

[00:01:50]
But in exercise 2 your task is to take what we've learned about naming our function expressions and using block scoping, take what you know now about lexical scope and improve the code. So we're not adding any new features, we're just improving the code by usage of block scoping, creating explicit scopes, that sort of stuff, okay.

[00:02:10]
Shouldn't be more than about five or eight lines of code that you;ll write or change to do this. So we'll give you about five minutes to work on the exercise and then talk through the solution.
