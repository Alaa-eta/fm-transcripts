>> Kyle Simpson: What questions came up as a result of going through it with your neighbor, anything?
>> Speaker 2: So we were having a back and forth on line 8 and 9 about whether foo got dealt with at compile time or was left to the second phase.
>> Kyle Simpson: Okay, the foo on line 8 is the question?

[00:00:18]

>> Speaker 2: Yes.
>> Kyle Simpson: Okay, so the foo on line 8 does get dealt with at compile time, from the perspective of needing to store that metadata that it is in the lhs position. But foo, on line 8, is not creating a variable entry, it's not making a marbel and putting it in a bucket, that happened on line 7.

[00:00:36]

>> Speaker 2: Okay.
>> Kyle Simpson: So it's kind of both.
>> Kyle Simpson: What else?
>> Speaker 3: Is there a good way of accessing that line 1 from line 4 and a half?
>> Kyle Simpson: No, the only way to access it is for a global variable you can use the cheat that global variables are properties of the global object.

[00:01:00]
Which is generally frowned upon, but if you really needed to, you could do it that way.
>> Speaker 3: So what's the best practice and fits the case?
>> Kyle Simpson: Well, the best practice is don't shadow if you're gonna need access to it.
>> Speaker 4: I'm sorry, what was the question?
>> Kyle Simpson: The question is, on line 4 and a half, is there any way to access the foo from line 1?

[00:01:26]

>> Speaker 5: The foo from line 1 and then line 4 are those the same marble?
>> Kyle Simpson: No.
>> Speaker 5: Or are they different marbles in different scopes, right, yeah.
>> Kyle Simpson: The foo from line 1 is a red marble in the red bucket, the foo from line 4 is a blue marble in the blue bucket.

[00:01:45]

>> Kyle Simpson: That's why we call that shadowing.
