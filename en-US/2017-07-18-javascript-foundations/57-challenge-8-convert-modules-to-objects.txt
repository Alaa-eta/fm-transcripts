>> Kyle Simpson: We're gonna finish by giving you some time to work on exercise 8. This will be the last thing we do. We'll talk through the solution briefly and wrap up the workshop, but I wanna give you some time to work on exercise 8. Exercise 8, I want you to definitely read the readme in it.

[00:00:16]
But in exercise eight, the spirit of what you're doing, let's open up that readme here.
>> Kyle Simpson: The spirit of what you are doing is to take out all of that module design that you did on app and UI. And instead make these into objects that can all virtually compose together.

[00:00:39]
So we're gonna actually have four different objects. We're gonna have app, UI, helpers and the instance of our application. We're gonna have all four of those and they're gonna virtually delegate together. And that means that we don't have any calls where we have to, in apps, say ui., we're just gonna be able to say this., and to call a method.

[00:01:00]
And it'll delegate to the right context if we need it. I'm not gonna give you that full allotted 20 minutes since we are drawing to a conclusion at the workshop. So don't worry if you're not gonna be able to make a substantial amount, if you wanna just spend a few minutes looking at the fixed version, that's okay.

[00:01:19]
But I definitely strongly recommend that you at some point, spend some more time working on this because it's one of the bigger. I think, one of the bigger pay offs from the workshop is to fully understand, now, what delegation gives us that even modules don't give us.
