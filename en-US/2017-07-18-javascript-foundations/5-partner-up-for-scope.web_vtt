&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: How do you feel so
far about this

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.310
process of asking these questions
of bam and where foo is?

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.380
Are you feeling a little
bit more confident?

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.920
Let's test that out.

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.280
For those of you that are here in person,
I

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.640
want you to actually find somebody sitting
next to you, or get up and walk around.

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.330
What you're gonna do is you're
gonna go through this role play.

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.040
You're gonna walk through those steps,
we'll go back a slide and

9
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.880
do it without the [INAUDIBLE] mode.

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.040
On this slide you're gonna go through and
one of you will play the scope manager,

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.770
and the other one of you will
play the compiler, and then swap.

12
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.900
And then, also goes to the run time and
do both roles.

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.530
Okay.

14
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.970
And do it exactly like I just said.

15
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.420
Hey, global scope I have this LHS for foo
I haven't heard it, do that exact thing

16
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.500
even though it sounds silly we need
to make sure that you fully get it.

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.130
And if there are questions that arise,

18
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.660
which they're generally always are, feel
free to raise your hand and ask questions.

19
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.820
I'm gonna give you about three, or four
minutes to just play around with that, so

20
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.700
find somebody.

21
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.810
If you're online, find somebody that's
in the chat room to pair up with and

22
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.610
do it over an IM, or something like that.

23
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.540
If you're watching this video at
a later time, go find a coworker and

24
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.670
do the exercise with them, okay?

25
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.160
But actually do this, because this
is how you get that ingrained,

26
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.530
that instinct of how
the Lexical Scope works, all right?

27
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.710
We'll take a few minutes, let you
practice that, and then we'll come back.
