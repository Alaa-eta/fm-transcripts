&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We're gonna finish
by giving you some time to work on

2
00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:04.360
exercise 8.

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.470
This will be the last thing we do.

4
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.660
We'll talk through the solution
briefly and wrap up the workshop, but

5
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.300
I wanna give you some time
to work on exercise 8.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.070
Exercise 8, I want you to
definitely read the readme in it.

7
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.730
But in exercise eight,
the spirit of what you're doing,

8
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.831
let's open up that readme here.

9
00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.299
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The spirit of what you
are doing is to take out all of that

10
00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:34.660
module design that you did on app and UI.

11
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.020
And instead make these into objects
that can all virtually compose together.

12
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.740
So we're gonna actually have
four different objects.

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.000
We're gonna have app, UI, helpers and
the instance of our application.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.170
We're gonna have all four of those and
they're gonna virtually delegate together.

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.850
And that means that we don't
have any calls where we have to,

16
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.970
in apps, say ui., we're just gonna be
able to say this., and to call a method.

17
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.760
And it'll delegate to the right
context if we need it.

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.240
I'm not gonna give you that full
allotted 20 minutes since we are drawing

19
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.360
to a conclusion at the workshop.

20
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.190
So don't worry if you're not gonna be
able to make a substantial amount,

21
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.000
if you wanna just spend a few minutes
looking at the fixed version, that's okay.

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.370
But I definitely strongly
recommend that you at some point,

23
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.330
spend some more time working on this
because it's one of the bigger.

24
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.811
I think, one of the bigger pay offs from
the workshop is to fully understand, now,

25
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.023
what delegation gives us that
even modules don't give us.
