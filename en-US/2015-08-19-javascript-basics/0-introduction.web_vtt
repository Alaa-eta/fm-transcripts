2
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.835
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It is a fantastic
honor to be back for as he said,

3
00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.285
the fourth time.

4
00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:47.895
Front End Masters is holds kind
of a special place in my heart.

5
00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:51.116
I've said this before,
I think on my other videos.

6
00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:55.772
But almost three years ago when I was
moving from being a developer into being

7
00:00:55.772 --> 00:01:00.445
a teacher, I had gone independent, but
I was moving to become a developer.

8
00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:04.495
I mean, to become a teacher from having
been a consultant and developer and I was

9
00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:08.485
kind of trying to get into this teaching
thing or at least had thought about this

10
00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:12.013
teaching thing and it was fortuitous
that at that same point in time.

11
00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:15.899
Mark reached out to me sort of
unbeknownst, I hadn't really known him or

12
00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.440
followed a lot of his stuff.

13
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.889
I'd heard a little bit but
not a lot and he reached out and

14
00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.119
asked if I would wanna come up and
teach a workshop and

15
00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.981
that was sort of sight unseen I hadn't
done formal teaching like that before.

16
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:30.767
Certainly done a lot of
conference speaking, but

17
00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:32.051
teaching is quite a bit different.

18
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:33.591
And so I credit Mark for

19
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:37.819
giving me my start,
if you will in this whole teaching thing.

20
00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.888
And now three years later,
that's what I do for a living full time.

21
00:01:40.888 --> 00:01:45.410
Travel all over the world and teaching
about JavaScript, and related things.

22
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.542
And so I owe a lot of that start
to Mark and I appreciate it, and

23
00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.066
definitely I'm honored to be back.

24
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:56.415
So today, I wanna just take a few
moments before I even sort of

25
00:01:56.415 --> 00:02:01.385
officially get started just to kind
of level set some expectations.

26
00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:02.961
Mark kind of already mentioned this,

27
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:05.137
but I wanna make sure
everybody's on the same page.

28
00:02:05.137 --> 00:02:08.153
This is a change of pace from
what I typically teach, but

29
00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:10.213
I think it's every bit as important.

30
00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:14.241
If not, more important that we
teach from this perspective and

31
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:17.517
I think there are lots and
lots of great materials.

32
00:02:17.517 --> 00:02:18.433
There are great books.

33
00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:19.369
There are great blogs.

34
00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.805
There are great websites out there,
I recommended many of them before.

35
00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:27.978
There's a fantastic website called
JavaScript for cats, jsforcats.com.

36
00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:33.297
If you haven't checked that out,
it's a fantastic website by a really

37
00:02:33.297 --> 00:02:38.986
smart dude named Max Ogden [COUGH] and
then there's great books on the topic.

38
00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:42.734
Like for example, I think a really good
book once you've gotten at least somewhat

39
00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:46.373
of a foundation with JavaScript and you
wanna go further, I think a great book is

40
00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:49.333
Eloquent JavaScript and
that's a really great place to start.

41
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.180
So, there's lots of resources.

42
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.090
I've already spent lots and lots of
time talking to you about the different

43
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.430
resources that I've found and
that that I believe in and endorse.

44
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.240
But one thing that I think has
been a little bit lacking and

45
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.160
that's kind of why I was so

46
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.160
insistent on wanting to do this part of
this workshop today is a lot of times,

47
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.450
they start with an assumption that you
already understand the concept of what

48
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.380
a variable is or what a function is,
or what a loop actually means.

49
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.659
And in fact, with my own book series,
which I'll talk about in just a moment.

50
00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.913
I kind of made that assumption.

51
00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:26.562
I made the assumption that there was
this cliff that you showed up to

52
00:03:26.562 --> 00:03:29.823
the books already knowing
something about programming and

53
00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:33.621
I got a lot of feedback from people
saying, hey, this sounds great.

54
00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:36.599
Books are really cool, but
I wasn't ready for them yet.

55
00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.821
I needed something else first.

56
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:42.396
And so long after I had all ready
started the book series, I went back and

57
00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:45.153
said, well,
what can I do to create that footbridge?

58
00:03:45.153 --> 00:03:49.703
What could I do to help people get up and
going and I decided to write the book for

59
00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:52.022
the book series called up, and going.

60
00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:54.519
So, for
this first half of our discussion for

61
00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.736
this discussion that we're gonna go
through over the next couple of hours.

62
00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:01.132
The goal is to go through
that book content.

63
00:04:01.132 --> 00:04:07.403
It's a rather short book about 60 or
70 printed pages worth of book content,

64
00:04:07.403 --> 00:04:12.681
but it starts from assumption of
no programming experience at all.

65
00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:15.346
Talking to you about the basics
like even what a code editor is.

66
00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:18.785
So if you're watching this and
you feel like that's too basic for you,

67
00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:21.705
I promise that as we progress,
we get more and more into it and

68
00:04:21.705 --> 00:04:23.847
we'll pick you up somewhere along the way.

69
00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:27.834
So don't feel too bored or too tune me
out, but we don't want to lose people.

70
00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.842
If you showed up today or to this
to this video, if you showed up and

71
00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:34.841
you don't have anything, I wanted to make
sure if there wasn't another resource that

72
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.335
had ever done this, I wanted to make
sure to provide that resource for you.

73
00:04:38.335 --> 00:04:43.273
So both in written form, certainly go over
the book, because we will go over that and

74
00:04:43.273 --> 00:04:47.536
that is essentially the written form
of this part of today's workshop.

75
00:04:47.536 --> 00:04:50.699
But I also encourage you to check
out all those other resources that I

76
00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.527
was mentioning too and you kind of put all
of those different pieces together, and

77
00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.379
get a good foundation of programming.

78
00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.366
It is much more important to get
a foundation in programming that I think

79
00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.098
a lot of people give credit to.

80
00:05:02.098 --> 00:05:07.079
I started programming when I was
a teenager way back in like the early 90s

81
00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:10.613
and I didn't have any kind
of formal education, and

82
00:05:10.613 --> 00:05:12.642
I figured it out the hard way.

83
00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:15.181
And when I came back later and
did formal education,

84
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:18.642
I had to relearn an awful lot of stuff and
I'd like to encourage you not to

85
00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:22.473
necessarily take that path of learning
it the wrong way over and over and over.

86
00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:25.012
And eventually, finally,
picking it up the right way.

87
00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:27.146
It's a good idea to get
those good foundation.

88
00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:31.009
So even though it may not look super
impressive on a resume to say,

89
00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.900
I took an intro programming course or
whatever.

90
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.738
That's really, really important and
even I'm willing to bet.

91
00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:39.600
Even if you have some programming
experience, you know, for

92
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.874
instance, what a loop is.

93
00:05:40.874 --> 00:05:44.274
I think when we start to talk about loops,
you may see that there are some slightly

94
00:05:44.274 --> 00:05:47.239
different concepts related to loops
that maybe you've seen before.

95
00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:50.534
Maybe you've only thought about it
as a syntax and not as a concept.

96
00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:54.664
So even for the experienced programmer,
I think there's little tidbits here that

97
00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:58.086
can kind of tweak your mindset a little
bit and that's really the goal

98
00:05:58.086 --> 00:06:01.154
is to make sure that that foundation
is as firm as possible, so

99
00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:03.515
that all the other stuff
that we do makes sense.

100
00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:06.386
So as we go throughout the rest
of the content material,

101
00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:10.726
through both halves of today and the other
courses tomorrow, we'll progressively

102
00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:14.716
build upon that understanding and
we wanna make sure that, that is solvent.

103
00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:18.855
So, that's kind of an expectation of where
to start is that we'll start with the zero

104
00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:19.495
knowledge.

105
00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:23.356
By the end of this first half of today
having gone through the up and going,

106
00:06:23.356 --> 00:06:26.596
it's essentially equivalent
to the knowledge of say, one,

107
00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:29.544
two maybe three months of
experience with JavaScript.

108
00:06:29.544 --> 00:06:30.978
You're not an expert programmer.

109
00:06:30.978 --> 00:06:32.660
You're not expected to
be an expert programmer.

110
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.992
You're not even expected to know how to
write a complete application from scratch,

111
00:06:36.992 --> 00:06:41.215
but you should at least feel comfortable
with that and that will be our goal today.

112
00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:46.533
So interrupt me and ask lots of questions,
because there won't be hardly any lecture.

113
00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:49.383
They'll be an awful lot of I will
read through a portion of the book or

114
00:06:49.383 --> 00:06:52.138
talk about a portion of the book,
illustrate some of that stuff.

115
00:06:52.138 --> 00:06:55.782
Takes in the code samples and expound
upon them in my code editor, and then let

116
00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:59.444
you practice those things, and they'll
be a lot of back and forth with that.

117
00:06:59.444 --> 00:07:03.279
So if I skip over something or if I say
something a little bit too quick or

118
00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.595
you'd like to go back,
make this a very interactive thing,

119
00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:09.209
cuz I don't want it to
just be a boring lecture.

120
00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:12.294
So, that's kind of some ground rules for
what to expect with the course.

121
00:07:12.294 --> 00:07:16.290
By the end, you should have two,
three months experience equivalent and

122
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.020
then the second half of what we'll go
through later today will be more applied.

123
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.780
So there won't be as much
theory discussion, but

124
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.850
more application discussion and
we'll walk through a little simple

125
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.790
site application and
apply some of our knowledge to that.
