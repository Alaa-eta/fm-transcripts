2
00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:06.010
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Without any further ado
I probably should start off with this.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.910
But I'm Kyle Simpson, getify.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
Known as getify online, you can follow
me on Twitter if you're into that whole

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.070
online stalking thing, getify.me.

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.710
There's all the different places online.

7
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.250
Essentially I'm getify everywhere on

8
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.840
from Gmail to everything
else that you can imagine.

9
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.890
If I'm, if there isn't a getify registered
somewhere then that site just doesn't

10
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.640
matter.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

11
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.820
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I'm kidding of course but

12
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.990
all the places that I can
be found under getify.

13
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.510
I will mention a couple of things.

14
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.440
So, I said earlier that I teach for
a living and

15
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.260
that means that I'm available for
teaching.

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.140
If you have an event.

17
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.390
If you have a company, an organization,

18
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.410
a club that would like to bring me in to
teach something related to JavaScript

19
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.400
related to the language
itself I'd love to do that.

20
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.170
So, please feel free to reach out.

21
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.620
I'm always looking for
more opportunities to spread that.

22
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.290
I'm sort of my self titled since
I'm self employed by my own

23
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.720
made up title is open web evangelist.

24
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.250
That's one of the best parts of being self
employed is that you get to make up your

25
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.790
own title and it can be as
fluffy as you want it to sound.

26
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.250
So, open up evangelist I just made up and

27
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.930
essentially what that is
intended to imply is that my goal

28
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.110
is to evangelize the open web platform
to as many people as possible.

29
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.210
And by evangelizing that means
both inspiring and teaching and

30
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.210
those go hand in hand.

31
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.330
I hope through the teaching it
inspires you to learn more and

32
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.180
do more with the Web Platform and

33
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.600
so they those are sort of two sides
of that same coin if you will.

34
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.910
So, open Web Platform and any of its
associated technologies with a particular

35
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.920
focus on JavaScript is what I spend
most of my time trying to figure out.

36
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.520
And I'll fully disclose that even with all
of my experience, I don't know JavaScript.

37
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.210
And that's why I called that book series
that we'll talk about in a minute,

38
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.230
I called it, You Don't Know JS,

39
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.470
because I think all of us are in various
states of coming to terms with what we

40
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.780
don't know, trying to figure
out what we need to learn next.

41
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.704
So, it's an ongoing process rather
than a fixed point in time.

42
00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:08.290
So, in addition to being in classrooms and
teaching corporate workshops or

43
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.450
speaking at conferences or whatever, I do
a fair amount of open source development.

44
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.840
Most of my open source development these
days is designed to aid in my teaching but

45
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.570
I'll just quickly highlight
a couple of projects.

46
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.360
So, you can get a sense of
the code that I try to write and

47
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.310
I open source pretty much all the code
that I write, so LABjs is a script loader,

48
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.630
dynamic script loader for
performance optimization purposes.

49
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.260
It's just designed to replace the script
tag with something that will load it more

50
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.330
performantly and give you more
control over the loading profile.

51
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.170
Lot of people think script loading is sort
of a dead or dying sort of technology.

52
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.310
I predict that there are changes that are
happening with the way our industry works

53
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.900
right now script loaders are going to
have a renaissance, they're going to make

54
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.330
a comeback, and I'd say over the next 12
to 18 months you're going to see more

55
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.460
attention given to that topic then has
been given over the last several years.

56
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.990
LABjs has been around for
almost six years now.

57
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.540
Stable for four.

58
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.640
That's its most important feature is that
it hasn't changed cuz it hasn't needed to.

59
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.810
Although it will if these
changes coming down the pike.

60
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.632
And it's been battle tested on
the big sites like Twitter,

61
00:03:12.632 --> 00:03:14.500
and and Zappos and so forth.

62
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.340
So, you can know and
rely upon that technology.

63
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.610
Grip is a templating engine and
actually the second half of the second day

64
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.370
when we get into shared JavaScript between
client and server and talk about that when

65
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.530
we get to that part of the course we're
gonna talk slightly more about groups.

66
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.220
But it's a templating engine designed to
approach this problem differently than

67
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.580
what I've seen almost every other
templating engine do cuz most fall into

68
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.850
two extreme categories either,
it's all about no logic, zero logic.

69
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.720
Like mustache or it's all about
a full programming language inside of

70
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.630
the template engine and both of those
have significant drawbacks to them.

71
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.820
And so,
to try to address some of those drawbacks,

72
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.770
I tried to ask, I think a better
set of questions about templating.

73
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.230
I don't propose that grips is the best
solution, that it's the right answer but

74
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.010
I think it's the right set of questions
to be asking about what we should

75
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.990
expect from templeting how we should
organize our approach to templeting.

76
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.920
I am approaching that not only from the
text in HTML sort of templeting world but

77
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.530
I'm also approaching C.S.S.
pre-processing from the same perspective.

78
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.256
So, there is C.S.S. pre-processing.

79
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.190
Somewhat like labs that's built
into that whole concept so

80
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.490
if those are pain points that you've ever
dealt with you might check out groups.

81
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.550
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you say you were gonna

82
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.920
discuss that tomorrow?
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We'll just briefly talk

83
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.730
about it cuz it is one of the technologies
that we'll use in the demo tomorrow, yeah.

84
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.660
So, even if you look at it and you hate
the syntax of the actual approach that I

85
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.730
take, I think those questions
are the right questions.

86
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.830
How can we find the right balance
between those two extremes?

87
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.160
And finally asynquence, this won't be
something we cover in this course but

88
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.800
if you have other courses that
cover asynchronous programming,

89
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.430
this is a little library that I built to
weave together lots of asynchronous flow.

90
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.170
Concern like promises and

91
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.690
generators and higher level patterns
like reactive programming and

92
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.210
things like that this are all sort of
lightly woven into this little single

93
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.560
library instead of having to get lots of
different libraries all paired together.

94
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.960
So, those are just a quick summary of some
of the stuff I work on there's probably.

95
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.030
Two dozen projects that I've got up and
get home in various states.

96
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.050
I do a lot of conference speaking as well,
so I'm not going to talk any

97
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.000
at all about these conferences but
there's lots of my lots of videos and

98
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.430
other things that my decks are on,
the slides are all up at my speaker deck.

99
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.260
There's also on my lanyard account
there's lots of Links to videos and

100
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.100
audio recordings and things like
that from these conference talks.

101
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.670
So, if you'd like to hear more about some
of the stuff that I've talked about at

102
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.370
conferences, there's probably two dozen
different talks that I've given over

103
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.740
the last six or seven years up there.

104
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.930
I've mentioned several times now,

105
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.140
wo we'll specifically talk about
the You Don't Know JS book series.

106
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.530
If you go to YouDontKnowJS.com It
redirects to the repo for

107
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.820
the book series because I'm writing
all of these books in the open for

108
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.610
free to freely read and access and

109
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.440
they are also being professionally edited
and produced and published through.

110
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.910
So, you can purchase the e-book or print
book form of the books if you prefer.

111
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.540
And I always appreciate that but

112
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.430
I encourage you to check out the content
first to see if you like it.

113
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.060
It's a series of books
six books in the series.

114
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.100
Five of them are done.

115
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.570
Four and a half of them are on shelves.

116
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.190
So, the up and

117
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.120
going one the one that we're talking about
will literally be on shelves in the next

118
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.420
few days and it's already been off
to the printers for a couple weeks.

119
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.050
So, five books done.

120
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.060
The sixth book which is talking about ES6,
the new changes to language and beyond.

121
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.350
ES6 and beyond is about 50 to 60%
done of course you can see it online.

122
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.990
It's about 50, 60% done and
expected to be on shelves.

123
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.770
My goal is to have that on shelves around
the middle of June which coincides

124
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.520
with the final ratification vote for
approving ES6 from The ECMA Committee.

125
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.330
So, hopefully,
this book will land at exactly that same

126
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.980
period of time on shelves.

127
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.110
So, that's the book series, the goal of
this book series was to try to attack

128
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.060
this mindset and if you're just starting
to learn, please don't adopt this habit,

129
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.950
you will see lots of people in
this industry that take the habit

130
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.050
that all I need to do is learn just
enough to get this one feature done so

131
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.080
my boss is happy and
then I don't go any further.

132
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.320
And I know we can chuckle about that and
say yes but there is truth to this.

133
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.410
That in our part of this industry
that in the JavaScript world,

134
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.700
there's a lot of that
mindset that prevails.

135
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.000
In fact our industry rewards
that type of mindset.

136
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.870
Just learn enough about this
framework to get a feature done and

137
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.870
that's what you get rewarded by bigger and
bigger projects and promotions at work and

138
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.140
better and better job titles and
things like that.

139
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.260
And there isn't a built in reward for
truly learning the thing,

140
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.900
there's a built in reward for
applying the thing.

141
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.070
So, my goal with the books,
with the trainings, with everything I do

142
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.230
basically as a career is to try to provide
or fill in that other side of the puzzle.

143
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.880
To provide deep learning that's
what these books are about,

144
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.360
that's what the trainings are about.

145
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.170
So, if you were to try to compare for
example the You Don't Know JS

146
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.390
book series to something more well known
like Douglas Crockford's the good parts.

147
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.480
I would say essentially by the way
it's a if it's a great book and

148
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.970
I'm not knocking the book at all.

149
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.530
We owe a lot of our industry to the fact
that that came out at a really critical

150
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.110
time when JavaScript could
have been forgotten.

151
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.690
And Doug Crawford's a big reason why
JavaScript survived and began to thrive.

152
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.610
So, all due credit to it but
it also taught an entire generation and

153
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.160
now we've got a second whole generation
of developers and at least, maybe more,

154
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.130
that have come along with this perspective
that you only need to know a little bit of

155
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.730
the language to be productive and
my approach is the opposite.

156
00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.200
You need to know all the language, so
if you're looking for a comparison

157
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.860
instead of the good parts that you know,
J.S. is the is the opposite.
