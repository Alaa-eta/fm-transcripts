00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.460
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, now, of course
when we start to shrink the page down,

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.900
nothing changes because we
haven't written those styles yet.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.610
So let's go ahead and write those styles.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.569
What's gonna happen then,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: First

5
00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:18.379
of all,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

6
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:20.650
let's talk about a plan here.

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.446
So in our first row we
have four going across,

8
00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:25.807
how do we want this to look on a tablet?

9
00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:33.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're currently at four,
we want to go to two and two, okay?

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.690
In the second row,

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.524
we have twos next to each other,
what would you like to have happen there?

12
00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:41.353
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You wanna stack them,

13
00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.670
you wanna leave it next to each other,
any strong preferences?

14
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.380
I think I left them next to
each other in my example,

15
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.600
but you could stack yours if you want.

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.906
How about the third row here?

17
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:58.208
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we have a one and
we have a three, do you wanna stack these?

18
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:03.214
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so we'll stack those.

19
00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:06.904
And then the fourth is pretty easy,
it just continues on the way it is right?

20
00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:14.909
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so then we have now
a behavior difference between this one,

21
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.520
the first one in row three, and
the ones that make up row one, right?

22
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.790
So the individual boxes in row one

23
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.950
are gonna grow in size to be two
columns wide when we go to a tablet.

24
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.740
But the item here in row three, the first
item, is gonna grow to occupy four.

25
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.654
So this is where my names come from,
I am going to call these col-1-2,

26
00:01:46.654 --> 00:01:50.500
and col-1-4.

27
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.978
So I'm gonna go ahead and
add those here in my CSS,

28
00:01:53.978 --> 00:01:59.935
col-1-2 and col-1-4.

29
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.400
So at desktop sizes,
they are gonna behave that way.

30
00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:13.806
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me also change
my fabulous color up here, col-1-4.

31
00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:18.324
And let me make sure I change my HTML.

32
00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.783
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So in my HTML,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go.

33
00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:34.523
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So in row one.

34
00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:40.447
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then in row three.

35
00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:51.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
hopefully when you refresh the page,

36
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.180
everything is exactly the same.

37
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.339
They all have the same colors,
they all still have the same behavior.

38
00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:02.826
And then we're ready to go ahead and
write these styles for our tablet display.

39
00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:09.252
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
here on my tablet, what are we gonna do?

40
00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.218
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody
have any suggestions?

41
00:03:15.554 --> 00:03:16.226
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How shall we start?

42
00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:23.619
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You all are in
the after-lunch slump.

43
00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:27.385
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Food comas all around.

44
00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:35.123
Okay, so col-1-2 and col-2 are gonna
have the same behavior, right?

45
00:03:35.123 --> 00:03:38.084
And their behavior's gonna be this.

46
00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:50.992
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 44%,
everything else is gonna be this,

47
00:03:50.992 --> 00:03:57.164
col-1-4, col-3, col-4.

48
00:03:59.537 --> 00:04:05.444
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And one we haven't
come to yet will be flex 0 0 92%.

49
00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.424
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
92% being full width, yes.

50
00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:15.558
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I don't wanna get too off
track on this because you had all ready

51
00:04:15.558 --> 00:04:17.050
naming conventions.

52
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But

53
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.119
generally people would stick
with the bootstrap column names-

54
00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:21.633
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And that's fine.

55
00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:22.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Compared to this way.

56
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That would be totally fine,
yes, absolutely.

57
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.270
I am combining a number of aspects here,
so I'm

58
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.610
not calling them specifically the extra
small, small, and large grid systems.

59
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.640
Because that's just a lot of
extra writing and so forth.

60
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.470
I'm combining a whole bunch of
things into single classes.

61
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.341
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right,
I just meant column-wise, so

62
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:46.691
it's just a little confusing
with the col-1, col-2.

63
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:49.540
But if there's a method to the madness,
it works for me.

64
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
that is a fair criticism.

65
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.900
Obviously you can call these class
names whatever you wanna call them, and

66
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.030
that is absolutely fine.

67
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.491
I'm trying to imply I'm different
from bootstrap though, so.

68
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.064
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Perfect.

69
00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:05.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, okay, so
let us refresh the page here.

70
00:05:08.112 --> 00:05:10.730
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] And
then hopefully, there we go,

71
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.590
we wind up with a break point.

72
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.430
And you'll notice that our column
ones here work perfectly well.

73
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.840
The floats, if you had played
around with your page a little bit,

74
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.969
you might have noticed that
they did not work so well.

75
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.413
But here we're working really well.

76
00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:34.970
The equal height aspect is baked in,
because this is Flexbox.

77
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.360
So we don't need any JavaScript in
order to make these equal height.

78
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.278
No matter what size these boxes are,
no matter which box is longer,

79
00:05:42.278 --> 00:05:46.146
the browser is very smart and
equalizes these very nicely to a row.

80
00:05:48.627 --> 00:05:49.127
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We go.

81
00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:55.091
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Looks like Firefox
picked this second to flip out.

82
00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:00.686
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Go Firefox,
all right, there we go.

83
00:06:00.686 --> 00:06:08.042
All right, so then the last thing is,
let's think about the mobile sizes here.

84
00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:11.642
So right now, these are all stacked
really nicely on top of each other,

85
00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:12.560
which is great.

86
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.190
But they actually have no margin
in between them at the moment.

87
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.395
So if you want that margin that's there,

88
00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:24.075
then that might be something to
add outside of a media query.

89
00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:24.934
And in fact,

90
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:30.557
the way I wound up writing this was,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's see, I think

91
00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:34.828
I just added to this particular style
right here with the attribute selector.

92
00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:39.483
So what I have on line 38, which is
the attribute selector of anything that

93
00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:42.481
starts with col- I have
a margin-left of 4%.

94
00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:48.940
And I'm adding to that
a flex property of 0 0 92%.

95
00:06:54.383 --> 00:07:01.869
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] And so then I
think that should help a little bit.

96
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:06.090
We wound up getting margins on either
side here, this is the margin-left.

97
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.042
If you want margin in between you can
certainly add more margin here as well,

98
00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:14.082
if you wanna have a little bit of space
between your boxes, you can have that.
