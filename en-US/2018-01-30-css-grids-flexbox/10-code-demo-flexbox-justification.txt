[00:00:00]
>> Jen Kramer: I usually find when I learn new syntax, it's helpful to determine what each little property is doing on its own. So that you can think about things more holistically. [COUGH] All right, so then, number five. We're gonna start to think about how we can put these boxes on the row.

[00:00:19]
And how we, the term is called, justify-content. And, as I say here, the justify-content is determining the distribution of the flex items, within the flex container, on the main axis. So the flex items are the little boxes on the main axis which, in our case, is row. So horizontally, how are they distributed?

[00:00:39]
Because they don't necessarily take up all of the space. If I go back to my CSS and I set my flex-flow to row wrap and not add anything new. What I have here, of course, are a series of boxes, right? And some of you designers out there are looking at this and like well we've got all of this hanging rag on the end.

[00:01:07]
I guess we'd call that a rag if we were looking at this and it was a paragraph, right? What if I don't want a rag like this, what if I wanna distribute the space in between these boxes differently? And that's what justify-content is all about. [COUGH] So what we're gonna do here is we'll add justify-content.

[00:01:28]
And there's a bunch of possible values for justify-content. So flex-start is the default, so everything is pushed to the left side. Those boxes, just the way that you just saw. If we said, flex-end, anyone wanna guess what happens with our boxes then?
>> Jen Kramer: What do you think flex-end is going to do?

[00:01:54]
A flex-start lines everything up on the left. What do you think flex-end is gonna do?
>> Speaker 2: Line up them on the right.
>> Speaker 3: Line up them to the right.
>> Jen Kramer: Line up them on the right. So if we say that, look at that in the browser, there they are lined up on the right.

[00:02:11]
If we said center, anyone wanna guess what center's gonna do?
>> Speaker 2: Put in center.
>> Jen Kramer: Put them in the center. So, if we refresh our page, there are all of our nice boxes centered. My gosh, isn't that amazing? We have boxes that are the width of the content.

[00:02:33]
And the browser's doing the math for you, aligning them in the center of the page. You are not able to do this with any other technology that you have at your fingertips. This is totally awesome and the code was easy, [SOUND]. So this is part of what makes Flexbox awesome.

[00:02:50]
Now comes the ones that I find confusing. Because I get confused by the words, space-between, space-around, and space-evenly. So, let's take a look at all of those individually. So space-between.
>> Jen Kramer: [COUGH] Space-between so what this is gonna do is it's gonna take these boxes, it's gonna shove them all the way to the ends.

[00:03:18]
All the way to the left, all the way to the right. It's gonna do the math, how big are the boxes in between? What are they doing? And then it takes whatever space is left over and evenly assigns it in between those remaining boxes. So you see, once again, over here all the way over on the left.

[00:03:36]
All the way over here on the right, we don't have any margin over there. We're shoved all the way up against the edge. But in between these boxes, we have a space that is the same. And the second row looks like a great big huge honking space because it is.

[00:03:52]
That's just the way our boxes happen to be working in this example. If we shrink this down a little bit, we wind up with a slightly different distribution. So that's space-between, space-around.
>> Jen Kramer: Space-around does it this way. So what just happened here? If you take a look at the space here to the left of box one, and the space in between box one and two.

[00:04:30]
And the space to the right of box four, that's about half of the space in between box three and four. So we're taking a little bit of the space and placing it on the left and the right side of the box. Where two boxes intersect, you have the right of one box and the left of the other.

[00:04:49]
They come together and form the larger space, make sense?
>> Jen Kramer: So you see how you can easily confuse, personally, I think, space-between and space-around. But space-around, space on two sides. Space-between, potentially space on one side. And then the last one is space-evenly.
>> Jen Kramer: And if we look at space-evenly they sort of jerk in a little bit like that.

[00:05:25]
Anyone think they know what's happening here with space-evenly?
>> Speaker 2: They're spaced evenly?
>> Jen Kramer: Spaced evenly meaning what?
>> Speaker 3: Same amount of space between them and on the sides.
>> Jen Kramer: Same space between one and two, two and three. And the same between, say, four and the edge and one and the edge.

[00:05:49]
So the space here between five and the edge, between five and six, and between six and the edge, that's all the same space. So space-evenly, this is a newer property, space-evenly. Space-around and space-between have been around for a while. Space-evenly is a relatively new one.
