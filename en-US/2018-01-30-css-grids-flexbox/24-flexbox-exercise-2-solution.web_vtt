WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I had some
little margin problems.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.020
&gt;&gt; Jen: You had some margin problems?

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That I just had to turn

4
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.440
around.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And the only difference I

6
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.040
can see between our two pages
is the testimonials goes up and

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.560
down just a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Just kind of a little bit,

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.950
if we had infinite time we could
tweak until perfection, right, yeah.

9
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.540
Okay, I'm not gonna worry about that but
the testimonies are as a little higher or

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.550
little lower, depending, okay?

11
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.737
How about everybody else?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Same.

12
00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:36.240
&gt;&gt; Jen: Same,

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.990
it's basically just the testimonials and

14
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.740
where they fit in space?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,

15
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.315
in relation to the inside of the text.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay,

16
00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.740
in relation to the text?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

17
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.340
&gt;&gt; Jen: Fair enough, okay.

18
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.520
So I tend not to be that
much of a perfectionist, and

19
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.150
sort of let things like that go.

20
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.580
Obviously if you had lots of design time

21
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.850
remaining with this that you
would sit there and tweak away.

22
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.570
But I question how much you're
actually gonna learn by doing that.

23
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.720
So I'll show you my
answer here which is what

24
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.640
you can follow along
here in the end folder.

25
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.580
So if you look in the end folder this
is what my solution looked like.

26
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.930
So I had some things going on here.

27
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.720
I have a class here.

28
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.890
I've left the rows in place.

29
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.780
the UL on the navigation,
I gave it a class of full width.

30
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.100
So I created a new class called full width
because what I found with the row that I

31
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.880
had existing, I think it was, It didn't
stretch quite all the way across, and

32
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.730
I think I had a little bit of
a gap on either side, right?

33
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.270
So a little 4% margin gap.

34
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.510
It wasn't lining up well, as I recall,
when I put the solution together.

35
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.820
So I created a class to get
around that particular problem.

36
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.870
The thing that is really notable here for

37
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.770
me is the way I handle
the side bar over here.

38
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.380
The main content of this is an article
with a class of call three.

39
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.490
That's no different than what we've
already looked at with the grid system

40
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.820
that we prototyped.

41
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.560
But here, with my sidebar,
what I wound up doing was,

42
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.550
this div, I put a div around the aside,
or maybe that was already there.

43
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.975
But I changed its classes, so

44
00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:26.330
that it's both a flex-item and a flex-row.

45
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.460
See how I did that?

46
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.940
So I had the flex-item,
we call 1-4 and it's also a row.

47
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.580
And these asides become the flex items.

48
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.550
So basically I have a little bit
of a nested grid going on here.

49
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.255
Does that make sense?

50
00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:48.225
Okay so then if we take a look at the CSS
associated with that particular piece,

51
00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:52.905
cuz I think that's the one sort of area
that had a level of difficulty to this.

52
00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:54.155
Is that fair to say?

53
00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:58.625
Pretty much everything else was pretty
straightforward on this example.

54
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:02.615
All right so let's look at the CSS and
how I dealt with that.

55
00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.405
I'll start down here at the desktop.

56
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.050
So at the desktop, I have

57
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.380
a flex item that's the side
bar with 100% width, okay?

58
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.020
So, instead of it being 92% I
had the margin on either side.

59
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.232
I didn't really want that in this case so
I gave it a flex basis of 100%.

60
00:03:28.232 --> 00:03:34.250
In the tablet portion of this, I added

61
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.422
that the flex basis was gonna be 44%.

62
00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:44.300
OK and then up,

63
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.000
here in the mobile styles,
outside of the media queries.

64
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.510
I have a flex basis of over 100% and I add
a bit of margin with this as well, okay?

65
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.725
So, then when you display the page,

66
00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:06.643
&gt;&gt; Jen: Then,

67
00:04:08.492 --> 00:04:09.853
&gt;&gt; Jen: Let me shrink it down,

68
00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:14.740
we hit our break point, and then I wind up
with my two boxes underneath like this.

69
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.640
And then everything

70
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.640
should stack on top of each other
at some point in time like that.

71
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.390
And I put in some extra padding here
because I thought it looked nicer and

72
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.900
stuff like that.

73
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.160
Design considerations.

74
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.270
Does that make sense to everybody?

75
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.600
What I did and why?

76
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.889
Do we have anybody else who did a
different approach that you would like to

77
00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.843
share?
&gt;&gt; Jen: I'm

78
00:04:42.843 --> 00:04:45.783
not saying I have a lock on
the perfect way of doing this, or

79
00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:49.990
even the only way of doing it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Just like comment

80
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.210
you used already created call classes,
and you used Flex with it.

81
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.650
Did anyone else do that?
&gt;&gt; Jen: So I'm sorry repeat that?

82
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.898
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Myra said she just used your

83
00:05:01.898 --> 00:05:08.270
call-classes, and then used Flex with it.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Right yes,

84
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.470
absolutely you could use the same
classes that were already there.

85
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.830
From the floats and you just
re-purpose them all to be flex box.

86
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.130
You get rid of the float part,
you get rid of the width part and

87
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.740
then replace those with
the appropriate flex properties.

88
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.200
That's definitely a way of doing that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What happened with the pizza

89
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.940
image?
&gt;&gt; Jen: The pizza image?

90
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is that a trick question?

91
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.368
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Can I have brakes

92
00:05:29.368 --> 00:05:32.540
on the [INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Jen: You mean the pie of

93
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.630
the month down here.

94
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.780
Is that what we're talking about?

95
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.440
The pie of the month?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: When you shrink the v port.

96
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.390
&gt;&gt; Jen: Which of course is pie day pie,

97
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.790
there are numbers all over it.

98
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.680
So when you shrink it,
what's going on with this?

99
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.900
Is that the question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I may have the image.

100
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.640
&gt;&gt; Jen: So yeah, so

101
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.220
since this is flex box,
the boxes are stretching.

102
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.600
It's estimating a box is stretching
to accommodate the content here.

103
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.320
So of course the pie box here
is also going to stretch, right,

104
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.090
the border's gonna stretch but
of course the image is not.

105
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.320
So that's what's going on here.

106
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.500
Does that help?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah I think so.

107
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.599
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay,

108
00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.357
and,
&gt;&gt; Jen: Let's put it to this

109
00:06:18.357 --> 00:06:19.800
dimension here.

110
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.680
So you'll notice that we have this
space over here on this side as well.

111
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.640
That comes from,
I had a style in here that locked down.

112
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.920
It might have been outside
the media query, but

113
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.320
lock down the maximum size of
those images to 225 or 250 pixels.

114
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.925
Did sort of a hack.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Search for

115
00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:52.990
it.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah, okay, that's one of them.

116
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.920
That's the article image and, yeah, so

117
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.660
here's the sidebar images and you see here
that I've rounded some of the corners.

118
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.690
They have a width of 100%, but
a max width of 250 pixels.

119
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.460
And so this is a hack for [INAUDIBLE].

120
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.210
Leads beautifully into a chapter from now.

121
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:20.570
So this is a hack to make the images scale
as we make the page larger or smaller.

122
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.760
Because they can go quote,
a 100% of the container width

123
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.070
up to a maximum of 250 pixels, and
at that point, it stops enlarging those.
