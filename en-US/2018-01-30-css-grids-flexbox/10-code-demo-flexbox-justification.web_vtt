00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I usually find
when I learn new syntax,

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.520
it's helpful to determine what each
little property is doing on its own.

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.908
So that you can think about
things more holistically.

4
00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:14.244
[COUGH] All right, so then, number five.

5
00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:19.390
We're gonna start to think about how
we can put these boxes on the row.

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.977
And how we, the term is called,
justify-content.

7
00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:27.638
And, as I say here, the justify-content
is determining the distribution of

8
00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:32.050
the flex items, within the flex container,
on the main axis.

9
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.150
So the flex items are the little boxes on
the main axis which, in our case, is row.

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.990
So horizontally, how are they distributed?

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.050
Because they don't necessarily
take up all of the space.

12
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.190
If I go back to my CSS and

13
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.590
I set my flex-flow to row wrap and
not add anything new.

14
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.680
What I have here, of course,
are a series of boxes, right?

15
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.146
And some of you designers out
there are looking at this and

16
00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:07.440
like well we've got all of
this hanging rag on the end.

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.760
I guess we'd call that a rag
if we were looking at this and

18
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.590
it was a paragraph, right?

19
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.970
What if I don't want a rag like this,

20
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.580
what if I wanna distribute the space
in between these boxes differently?

21
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.184
And that's what
justify-content is all about.

22
00:01:21.184 --> 00:01:28.688
[COUGH] So what we're gonna do
here is we'll add justify-content.

23
00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:34.132
And there's a bunch of possible values for
justify-content.

24
00:01:34.132 --> 00:01:40.387
So flex-start is the default, so
everything is pushed to the left side.

25
00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:43.290
Those boxes,
just the way that you just saw.

26
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.343
If we said, flex-end, anyone wanna
guess what happens with our boxes then?

27
00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:54.924
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What do you
think flex-end is going to do?

28
00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:57.784
A flex-start lines
everything up on the left.

29
00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.512
What do you think flex-end is gonna do?

30
00:01:59.512 --> 00:02:00.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Line up them on the right.

31
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.339
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Line up them to the right.

32
00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:03.128
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Line up them on the right.

33
00:02:03.128 --> 00:02:05.880
So if we say that,
look at that in the browser,

34
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.080
there they are lined up on the right.

35
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.280
If we said center,
anyone wanna guess what center's gonna do?

36
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Put in center.

37
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.950
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Put them in the center.

38
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.530
So, if we refresh our page,
there are all of our nice boxes centered.

39
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.180
My gosh, isn't that amazing?

40
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.197
We have boxes that
are the width of the content.

41
00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:37.110
And the browser's doing the math for you,
aligning them in the center of the page.

42
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.500
You are not able to do this with any
other technology that you have at your

43
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.540
fingertips.

44
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.005
This is totally awesome and
the code was easy, [SOUND].

45
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:49.070
So this is part of what
makes Flexbox awesome.

46
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.620
Now comes the ones that I find confusing.

47
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.775
Because I get confused by the words,
space-between, space-around, and

48
00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:00.480
space-evenly.

49
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.830
So, let's take a look at
all of those individually.

50
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.211
So space-between.

51
00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:13.331
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] Space-between so
what this is gonna do is it's gonna take

52
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:18.110
these boxes, it's gonna shove
them all the way to the ends.

53
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.960
All the way to the left,
all the way to the right.

54
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.500
It's gonna do the math,
how big are the boxes in between?

55
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.740
What are they doing?

56
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.530
And then it takes whatever
space is left over and

57
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.840
evenly assigns it in between
those remaining boxes.

58
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.290
So you see, once again,
over here all the way over on the left.

59
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.780
All the way over here on the right,
we don't have any margin over there.

60
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.990
We're shoved all the way
up against the edge.

61
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.420
But in between these boxes,
we have a space that is the same.

62
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.180
And the second row looks like a great
big huge honking space because it is.

63
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.030
That's just the way our boxes happen
to be working in this example.

64
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.220
If we shrink this down a little bit,

65
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.356
we wind up with a slightly
different distribution.

66
00:04:01.356 --> 00:04:06.728
So that's space-between, space-around.

67
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Space-around
does it this way.

68
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.710
So what just happened here?

69
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:26.242
If you take a look at the space
here to the left of box one,

70
00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:30.374
and the space in between box one and two.

71
00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:33.052
And the space to the right of box four,

72
00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:37.420
that's about half of the space
in between box three and four.

73
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.360
So we're taking a little bit of
the space and placing it on the left and

74
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.860
the right side of the box.

75
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.397
Where two boxes intersect,
you have the right of one box and

76
00:04:48.397 --> 00:04:49.376
the left of the other.

77
00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:52.887
They come together and
form the larger space, make sense?

78
00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:58.983
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So you see how you can
easily confuse, personally, I think,

79
00:04:58.983 --> 00:05:01.520
space-between and space-around.

80
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.825
But space-around, space on two sides.

81
00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:11.109
Space-between, potentially
space on one side.

82
00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:13.850
And then the last one is space-evenly.

83
00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:23.937
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And if we look at
space-evenly they sort of jerk in a little

84
00:05:23.937 --> 00:05:25.640
bit like that.

85
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.853
Anyone think they know what's
happening here with space-evenly?

86
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:34.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're spaced evenly?

87
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.950
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Spaced evenly meaning what?

88
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Same amount of space
between them and on the sides.

89
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.820
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Same space between one and
two, two and three.

90
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.970
And the same between, say, four and
the edge and one and the edge.

91
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.653
So the space here between five and
the edge, between five and six, and

92
00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:55.210
between six and the edge,
that's all the same space.

93
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.876
So space-evenly,
this is a newer property, space-evenly.

94
00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:02.210
Space-around and space-between
have been around for a while.

95
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.770
Space-evenly is a relatively new one.
