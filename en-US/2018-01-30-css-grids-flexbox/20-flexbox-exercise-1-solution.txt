[00:00:00]
>> Speaker 1: Why are you using 44%?
>> Jen Kramer: Why am I using 44%? Because, in our first row, where we had the four boxes, I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint here.
>> Jen Kramer: Each of these boxes is 20% rise, so 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%. If I combine two of these, so I've got column one here, and column one here.

[00:00:25]
So, 20 and 20 is 40, don't forget the margin in between these, which is 4%, so it becomes 44%, okay? Other questions? [BLANK_AUDIO?
>> Speaker 1: Regarding the column names, what does column, dash one, dash four [CROSSTALK] in exactly?
>> Jen Kramer: So, it's gonna go from one column wide, to four columns wide.

[00:00:52]
That, this is my convention, and as Peter was pointing out earlier, maybe it doesn't work for you, maybe it's not understandable for you, that's totally okay. You can call your classes, whatever you want.
>> Speaker 1: So, it'll be one item at a certain screen with,
>> Jen Kramer: Yes.
>> Speaker 1: And then, four items wide at the greatest.

[00:01:09]

>> Jen Kramer: Correct.
>> [INAUDIBLE].
>> Jen Kramer: One column wide to four columns wide. Or one column wide to two columns wide. That's where my numbers are coming from.
>> Speaker 1: Are you looking for that much margin below the first row?
>> Jen Kramer: 4% under the first row? Or, that would really be a design decision.

[00:01:31]
If you wanna have margin in between your rows, you can certainly add that. I think, most float based grid systems don't have that. But you can certainly add that, easily enough.
>> Speaker 1: Can you make your style sheet visible? Trying to recall follow the naming convention.
>> Jen Kramer: Sure.
>> Jen Kramer: Put up the style sheet.

[00:01:53]

>> Speaker 1: I mean, is that in the repo that we can just?
>> Jen Kramer: Yeah, it's in the answers.
>> Speaker 1: I can just link to it?
>> Jen Kramer: Yeah, you can take a look at the end state, and that's got all of the CSS in it. So the chapter three folder, if you look inside of the end folder, you can take a look at what's there, in the terms of the html, the CSS.

[00:02:11]
In this particular exercise, what we're going to do is.
>> Jen Kramer: You've added a fifth row to your html.
>> Speaker 1: I think they're talking about the files.
>> Jen Kramer: There are no files, just keep working with the files that you have.
>> Jen Kramer: Keep working with the files that you have.

[00:02:32]

>> Jen Kramer: Okay, like ten minutes.
>> Speaker 3: So you can still create new classes right from this?
>> Jen Kramer: Yes, absolutely, absolutely. Create new classes? If you can't do it without rearranging the HTML, feel free to rearrange the HTML. So we have a few people here in class get it. I'm hoping that some of you online got it.

[00:02:54]
So Peter says, he's got an answer here for us. So what'd you do, Peter? What'd you do first in your HTML? What did you call these classes?
>> Peter: What I use is sort of bootstrap method of doing it.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: So, the first one I called Col3.

[00:03:11]

>> Jen Kramer: Col3, okay.
>> Peter: And then, the middle one.
>> Jen Kramer: Uh-huh.
>> Peter: I'm sorry, I called it Col3-6.
>> Jen Kramer: three dash six.
>> Peter: So there's a six going along with it.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: And the next one was col-6-3.
>> Jen Kramer: six, three, [LAUGH], okay.
>> Peter: And then, you have the same for that one.

[00:03:29]

>> Jen Kramer: Col-6-3, okay.
>> Peter: Sorry, three dash six.
>> Jen Kramer: Three dash six, okay. So, in other words, to translate for everybody else, the two boxes on the left and the right have the same class name. The one in the middle has a different class name, okay? And then in our CSS, what did you put where?

[00:03:53]

>> Peter: So the, do you wanna start with the desktop or with the tablet?
>> Jen Kramer: Sure, let's start with the desktop.
>> Peter: Okay, so with the desktop I put the col-6-3 with, I guess for you, it would be the col-2.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: So the,
>> Jen Kramer: Well, I'll just write it out this way to make it straight forward, so it flex-0.

[00:04:16]

>> Peter: 0044.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay, so obviously, we could combine those styles, but okay, and then?
>> Peter: And then, I added my col-3-,6, to what would be your col-1's.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: So that's the flex 0020%.
>> Jen Kramer: 20%, okay, so something like that, all right.
>> Peter: And then, I put col-3-6 in the 44% one, so the top.

[00:04:44]

>> Jen Kramer: Okay, so, col-3-6 would be 44%.
>> Peter: Yep.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: And the -6-3,
>> Jen Kramer: Yep.
>> Peter: Would go with the others-
>> Jen Kramer: Would be the 92%?
>> Peter: Yep.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: And then, I also gave col-6-3, a order of negative one.
>> Jen Kramer: Tricky.
>> Peter: To put it at the front, no matter what.

[00:05:14]

>> Jen Kramer: Okay, so it'll be at the front, no matter what. So this is the basically, the class of the fat box in the middle. The content box, the way I'm thinking of it. He's put in a negative order one, so that will show up at the front of the list.

[00:05:29]
Col three hyphen three hyphen six, which is left or right ends. That has no order to it, so it will follow after, okay? Great, and then what?
>> Peter: I did one last thing.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: It wasn't working well on my computer so I gave this media query a limit.

[00:05:50]

>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: So it has a minimum width, right now.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay.
>> Peter: But I also wrote in, and max width.
>> Peter: Of 767 pixels.
>> Jen Kramer: Like that, okay. So, here we've limited this particular media query. So in other words, the styles that are here deactivate when we get to desktop sizes.

[00:06:17]
So let's test, and see how that works. If we refresh the page, here's the row on the bottom. And I don't have it in color, because I haven't specified the styles, but we could do that. And then, when I shrink it down, here we go, we get to my right break point.

[00:06:39]
So you see now, Boston cream pie, which is in the middle is now on the top and coconut cream pie and pie are underneath, okay? And presumably, as I shrink it down even further, then these guys are just gonna stack and be happy. Stacked in of course, the order that the HTML was placed in.

[00:06:56]
Now, so the way Peter had to make this work was he added this max width of 767. Can anyone think of a way that we could make this work without changing the media query? Anyone have a suggestion on that?
>> Speaker 5: In the desktop styles?
>> Jen Kramer: Uh-huh.
>> Speaker 5: You could reset the order number.

[00:07:17]

>> Jen Kramer: We could reset the order number in the desktop styles. So instead of, limiting our media query here, which is completely legitimate. And you can totally go ahead and use a range like this. But if it might be awkward to do that if you've already got a page existing that relies on just the min-width being true.

[00:07:39]
You can do something different, which will be to come down here to these classes, six-three, and the three-six. And what would you recommend for that?
>> Speaker 5: I set it to zero.
>> Jen Kramer: Just a zero? And both of these to zero? Or one of them to zero?.
>> Speaker 5: I only had to play with the one.

[00:07:56]

>> Jen Kramer: You only had to play with the one. So here, we set column, hyphen, six hyphen, three, the fat one in the middle, we set that to a negative one, here. So down here at the bottom, we can set our order on that same class to zero. And then that should preserve the desktop order here, as we scrunch this up.

[00:08:22]
So, there we go with the pies stacked on top of each other. And then, when we scrunch it down even further, there they go, one, two, three, stacked all on top. Now, that is a kind of reordering that would simply not be possible with the floats, okay? Or possible with a great deal of Math perhaps.

[00:08:43]
But to be able to pull out these items within a row, and then make them appear in whatever order you want. It's really, really powerful and it' so simple. So, that's a really great trick to have.
