00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:01.497
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here’s what I’d like for
you to do.

2
00:00:01.497 --> 00:00:02.445
In your HTML,

3
00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:08.102
I want you to add a fifth row.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

4
00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:11.446
So, let me hit return a few times,
so you can see what I’m doing.

5
00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:15.902
All right, so
here’s what I’d like for you to do.

6
00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:23.996
I’m gonna copy row number one.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just for

7
00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:26.804
its content and stuff.

8
00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:31.334
I'm gonna paste it down here at
the bottom, after the end of row four.

9
00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:37.803
So on line 79, I'll go ahead and paste
in effectively what is row one again?

10
00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:41.361
What I want you to do is I want
you to do this as a row five.

11
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:45.657
And what we're gonna do,
is we're gonna do a 1-2-1 layout.

12
00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:50.444
So in other words, a left column,
a wider center column, and

13
00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:52.846
a narrow right column, okay?

14
00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:56.421
So we need three articles to achieve that.

15
00:00:56.421 --> 00:01:00.362
So you're gonna get rid of
the pumpkin pie at the end.

16
00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:03.883
And obviously these
are not the right classes.

17
00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:10.508
So I'm gonna remove those as well.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

18
00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:15.290
I want you to do the following, in this
row number five that we've just created.

19
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.270
First of all what I'd like you to do is
figure out how to get it work on desktop,

20
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.935
1, 2, 1, okay?

21
00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:28.092
1, 1, 2, 1, all right?

22
00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:33.312
And then as an additional step,
I want you to give some thought as to what

23
00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:38.619
this would look like on, let's say
tablet or mobile, and the order that

24
00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.025
I'd like to have is that center column
of information to be listed first.

25
00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:45.559
Followed by the left and

26
00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:51.602
right columns next to each other.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

27
00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:53.942
Do I need to draw a diagram or, yes,

28
00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:56.603
draw a diagram?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Draw a diagram.

29
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:03.792
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Desktop dimensions,

30
00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:11.449
that's how I want your row to look,

31
00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:16.053
1, 2, 1, okay.

32
00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:20.811
And then when you go to
say tablet dimensions,

33
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:27.283
I want it to look this way,
2 at the top, 1 and 1 underneath.

34
00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:30.036
Don't rearrange your HTML.

35
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:40.880
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: See if you can do
it without rearranging your HTML.
