[00:00:00]
>> Jen Kramer: So now that we've got that in place and we have our shapes, the next thing that we're probably interested in doing is cleaning up these sizes a little bit. What I did in the painting, kinda like a cooking show, where Julia Child's slides the turkey into the oven, and says in three hours, it looks like this.

[00:00:15]
And she opens the top oven and pulls out the baked turkey. We'll do the same thing here. So what I did here with my painting was I used a tool that comes with Firefox called the web developer toolbar and it's got one of those rulers on it that measures things in pixels.

[00:00:32]
You may have a similar tool, it may not be from the web developer toolbar. But you basically need some kind of tool that can measure pixels. And I'll show you What mine looks like.
>> Jen Kramer: Here in Firefox, if I go to painting.png.
>> Jen Kramer: Extra character there. Okay, so the web developer toolbar that I have plugged in is right here.

[00:01:05]
If you type web developer toolbar into Google, you'll find it, it's an extension from Chris Pederick and it's available for both Chrome and Firefox. It was one of the earliest web development tools that was out there. And if you go to, once you've got the web developer toolbar in place, if you go to, here's Miscellaneous, and then Display Ruler.

[00:01:28]
This particular one, you can drag this little ruler around, and sort of let's make it match up here we'll see, one of the nice things is that you can blow up your image and the pixel dimensions here are still the same. So, we can drag this around and come up with a size.

[00:01:51]
And, it's reporting that size up here. So, this is 453 by 435 pixels. Okay, so this is the kind of thing that you can do with a tool like this, and you can measure the sizes of these particular squares. And so I went ahead and I did all that for you.

[00:02:07]
You can thank me later. [LAUGH] And then so what we're going to do then in our CSS, we're gonna scroll back on up here to the wrapper and we're gonna introduce two more properties to this. One is grid-template-rows and the other is grid-template-columns. Okay? So these two properties are a way of calling out a grid system for your whole entire webpage.

[00:02:38]
So you can say, here to your browser, I would like to create some number of rows, some number of columns. And I can give all those rows and columns dimensions on the page, okay? And I'm just gonna do this in pixels for now. There are plenty of other units that you can use that are not pixels, but given the fact that we're recreating a painting that has a very thick size and we're not worried about content or anything, we're just going to do this first example all in pixels.

[00:03:08]
And then i'll introduce you to some of those, probably much better units for doing website design and development later on today. So basically, the numbers that I came up with here for my template rows and template columns are as follows: so 170 px 210 px 61px 61px. Okay, so those will be our four rows.

[00:03:41]
And if you take a look at the painting, you can see where that comes from. 170 for this a, 210 for this b. And then the heights of f and g are about the same. About 61 pixels tall, okay? So that's where those come from. Yes.
>> Speaker 2: So you can enter any sorta number in there?

[00:03:59]

>> Jen Kramer: Yes.
>> Speaker 2: And it will just keep knowing how many columns forever?
>> Jen Kramer: Yes, so the fact that I am going to now call out four numbers here, the grid system will create four rows for me and those are going to basically be the heights of those rows when we combine it with the columns it probably makes a little bit more sense.

[00:04:19]
But those are how tall those rows are going to be, and then for our columns we're going to have the numbers of 124 px 376 px 42 px, okay? So those are gonna be our three columns. So you can see how those numbers intersect to form squares on the page.

[00:04:45]
Now what happens if we happen to have, we go through H, I think on this page? What if we had I, J, K and L? What would happen at that point?
>> Jen Kramer: Anyone wanna take a guess?
>> Speaker 3: Probably automatically create a new row.
>> Jen Kramer: Keep creating more rows and more columns, according to this sort of pattern, okay?

[00:05:12]
Great, so then for the grid gap, we set that up 10 px initially. Change that to 30 px 20 px. Okay grid gap can be specified in of course, the column basis or in the row basis and we have two numbers here. You can think of this just like we do with margins zero auto.

[00:05:38]
Which you've probably put in a webpage before, right? Zero is the top and the bottom. Auto is the left and the right. Same kinda thing here. 30 px is the top and the bottom or the space between the rows. 20 px is the up and down or the space between the columns.

[00:05:53]
Makes sense? Okay. Now because this is a painting, the exact layout here and because I can't specify my grid gap precisely for every single one of these gaps. We'll be off by a few pixels on the painting but we'll be pretty close, close enough for our purposes. So if you refresh your web page, you should see we're getting pretty close to what that is.

[00:06:29]

>> Jen Kramer: And you could probably finesse those numbers a little bit more and get it even closer. But you get the idea. Does anybody have any questions at this point? Yes.
>> Speaker 2: Is there any way to color that grid gap or is that just background space?
>> Jen Kramer: What a wonderful question.

[00:06:49]
That was totally a plan. That's the next thing we're going to go into, is how we're gonna put the colors in. Any other questions at this point?
>> Speaker 4: Without specifying any additional rows, will that take on an auto height? Keeping the last value-
>> Jen Kramer: Sure.
>> Speaker 4: 42 pixels or restart at 124 pixels?

[00:07:07]

>> Jen Kramer: Sure, let's go ahead and try it. So let's just say that we have,
>> Jen Kramer: So I'm just gonna go ahead and add some more rows here, and I'm not gonna have any classes associated with them.
>> Jen Kramer: Or some more dibs I should say. All right, so there is some more stuff.

[00:07:28]
If we were to display that.
>> Jen Kramer: Here we go. They're showing up down here at the bottom as lines because I have no content in them. So, let me just give you a little bit of content.
>> Jen Kramer: So you can see down here at the very bottom of the webpage, there's some additional rows that ere added.

[00:08:13]
Those were those extra divs that I put in. They're as tall as their content which is like three letters. Okay? Because we didn't specify where they're supposed to go. This is again part of that what's called the implicit grid. As you start to read documentation you'll hear about the explicit grid and the implicit grid.

[00:08:33]
The explicit grid in this document are the things that we've actually called out dimensions for, all right. The implicit grid, it's just gonna continue on trying to fit the additional items that you add according to the pattern that you established. Okay.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay, cool. I'm gonna go ahead and take those out cuz we don't really actually want those.

[00:09:00]
Okay, so then the last part of finishing out the painting here is this. We're just gonna add a few colors. So I'm gonna add a background color,
>> Jen Kramer: Of black to my wrapper here.
>> Jen Kramer: And I'm gonna take out my background image so you can either erase that or you can just comment it out.

[00:09:30]

>> Jen Kramer: I'm also gonna comment out the opacity of the divs, cuz I actually, I want that one at 100% not at 50%. Okay. And then all you have to do is look at the painting. So c is gonna be red. D is gonna be blue and g is gonna be yellow.

[00:09:50]
I haven’t taken the time to figure out the exact hex color for these. I’m just using red, blue, and yellow. But you are certainly welcome to get your little eye droppers out and figure out exactly what the hex colors are. So to this, I will simply add here on letter c, a background color of red.

[00:10:14]
On d a background-color: blue;
>> Jen Kramer: And I'll make text white in their too because so it'll be a little easier to see. And then finally on g I'll add a background
>> Jen Kramer: Color of yellow
>> Jen Kramer: Okay?
>> Jen Kramer: So if you go on ahead and refresh, you'll get something that looks pretty close to that original painting.
