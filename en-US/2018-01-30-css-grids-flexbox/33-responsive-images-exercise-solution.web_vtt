00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yesterday,
we spent the day covering Flexbox.

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.270
Today, we're gonna be looking at CSS Grid
and we're gonna be covering a whole bunch

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.830
of stuff, we're gonna look
at the basic syntax of grid,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.840
we're going to rebuild a couple
of paintings by Piet Mondrian.

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.920
If you don't know who that is, you will
by the time we're done, we are also going

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.960
to be laying out some pages with all kinds
of interesting little bits of details.

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.830
We're gonna be looking at nested grids,
and some offsets,

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.640
we're gonna look at different types of
syntax that go with the grid layouts.

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.025
And then, finally, towards the end of
the day, we'll look at how we can combine

10
00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:42.230
Flexbox, used in the right way, along with
grid, to create real world page layouts.

11
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.680
So, that's what's on tap for today.

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.525
As we did yesterday,
the lunch break will be between 12 and

13
00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:50.910
1 o'clock central time,
we're here in Minneapolis.

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.380
And there'll be lots of stuff for
you to do along the way in terms of

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.010
little projects and
coding kinds of things along the way

16
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.660
in addition to listening to me babble
away up here in front of the room.

17
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.090
You can ask all of the questions
you want on the chat,

18
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.720
Mark is monitoring the chat for us.

19
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.440
And so where I'd like to start today
is actually where we ended yesterday.

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.810
So right at the very end of the day
we were working in our files.

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.117
If you didn't join me yesterday
you can download the files at

22
00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:28.843
github.com/Jennumber4, W-E-B Jen for
web, /F-E-M,

23
00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:35.545
as in Frontend Masters, -layouts and
all the files are there to download.

24
00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:40.630
Yesterday's files were in day 1 Flexbox,
today's files are in day 2 grid.

25
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.630
In general, there's a beginning and end
state for every one of these folders, and

26
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.420
I'm calling them chapters,
as we move through the material.

27
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.230
So, we're actually starting with
yesterday's material in chapter 7,

28
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.600
called the Wrap Up Folder.

29
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.092
And we wanted to take a quick peek at
the assignment that I gave you as we were

30
00:01:57.092 --> 00:02:01.450
leaving yesterday and we can take
a look at what the answers were today.

31
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.400
So, while I go through those answers with
you, if you're out there on the Internet

32
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.280
and you have questions pertaining
to FlexBox from yesterday,

33
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.380
please go ahead and ask those in
the chat and I'll go ahead and

34
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.550
answer those as soon as I go
through the answers up here.

35
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.490
As always it's web design so there's lot
of different answers that are possible.

36
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.552
These are the answers that I came up with,
you may have something different, and

37
00:02:23.552 --> 00:02:26.134
they maybe be absolutely
totally right as well.

38
00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:30.920
So, what I'd ask you to do is part of
the wrap up portion of the Flexbox

39
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.530
portion of the day, was we had done
two things just prior to that.

40
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.770
One, we had laid out an image
gallery using Flexbox, and

41
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.480
we had taken a look at
some responsive images.

42
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.730
And so
what I asked you to do to finish things up

43
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.570
was to create a gallery page,

44
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.330
a history page, and if you had time,
also a home page for the website.

45
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.690
And so we'll go ahead and
take a quick peek at those.

46
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.720
All right so, on the history page,
the thing that I had asked you to do is to

47
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.160
take the image that we had here
of Marilee and swap that out for

48
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.760
different size images at
different dimensions.

49
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.230
And you did that using the picture tag and
using different

50
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.950
size images that you went ahead and
created and the picture fill [INAUDIBLE].

51
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.120
So if we go ahead and narrow down
our web browser here you'll see that

52
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.080
the size of this picture will
change at the various break points.

53
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.102
There we go,
smaller picture at that break point.

54
00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:42.715
And then, finally, a much smaller
image here for mobile dimensions.

55
00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:46.130
And if we take a look at the code to do
that, it should look pretty familiar,

56
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.190
compared to what we did yesterday.

57
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.170
So, here in history.html,

58
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.190
you can see that we have the script tags
that are running from lines 8 to 12,

59
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.350
that includes the little
bit of JavaScript that

60
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.870
tells the browser what a picture tag is,
if it doesn't happen to already know.

61
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.890
And then a line that calls the picture
fill script, and that is on line 12.

62
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.513
And then, as we scroll on down
the page here, if you go to line 33,

63
00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:25.044
this is the bit of code that calls
the picture tag, which is an HTML 5.1 tag.

64
00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:27.345
You'll see that I gave it
a class of float, right?

65
00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:31.577
So that's how I'm floating that picture,
no matter which version of the picture

66
00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:35.747
that I display, whether that's one of
these source tags or the final image tag,

67
00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:37.550
they'll all be floated, right?

68
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.630
So you'll see that we call
the different size images here.

69
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.090
They are associated with the appropriate
media queries as to what to display on

70
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.730
a page and by default the last image is
the mobile-friendly version of that image.

71
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.610
Okay, so that's the history page.

72
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.226
On the gallery page,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is very

73
00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:03.041
similar,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pull that up in

74
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:07.230
the browser, so here is the gallery
page and what I've got going on here was

75
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.354
I took that same design that
I had from the history page,

76
00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:14.290
dumped the right column so
that this is more of a full width.

77
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.220
And then I went ahead and

78
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.740
put my Flexbox-based grid system
right on inside of the pie gallery.

79
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.690
So, you see here, we have lovely
images on all the various lines.

80
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.850
And, as you shrink this down,

81
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.220
we go to two images across, and
then finally one image across.

82
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.538
And so the code for that,
if we take a look at gallery.html,

83
00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:43.025
you'll see I just copied in my
list that I already had created,

84
00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:47.598
we went through this as an exercise
yesterday in chapter 5, and

85
00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:51.354
I copied that HTML so
I didn't have to retype it all.

86
00:05:51.354 --> 00:05:54.758
And the only little change I
made is up here, in line 28,

87
00:05:54.758 --> 00:05:56.940
I gave it a class of gallery.

88
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.447
So, in my example in chapter 5,

89
00:05:59.447 --> 00:06:05.750
I used just the HTML tags themselves to
lay out this particular image gallery.

90
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.965
But with the addition of this class,
when you take a look at our CSS styling,

91
00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:16.202
and if you're looking at the end file for
that, it starts around line 84.

92
00:06:16.202 --> 00:06:21.278
You'll see that I have just used
that one class and associated it

93
00:06:21.278 --> 00:06:26.824
with the various tags that are in
that list via descendant selectors or

94
00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:30.880
sort of a combination
selector there on line 85.

95
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.420
And then that way I could keep the code
really super clean, only adding one class.

96
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.240
I didn't have to put a separate class
on each OI, or all the figures, or

97
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.360
anything like that.

98
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.230
So, that's how I did that.

99
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.150
And then finally we have a home page.

100
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.070
And I didn't give you any art
direction on the homepage at all.

101
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.634
I said, if you have time and

102
00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:56.991
you happen to look at the branding folder
that has the content inside of it and

103
00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:01.239
pictures and so forth, feel free to
go ahead and put together a homepage.

104
00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:05.480
So I created one of these,
homemade pies for every celebration,

105
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.568
I used the pictures of all the slices of
pie as a little background banner here,

106
00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:15.196
and then using the background image
techniques that I talked about late

107
00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:19.470
yesterday afternoon,
I went ahead and made that appear.

108
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.880
And you could see that that image
size does change partway through here

109
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.410
as I shrink the screen down.

110
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.270
And since it's a background image,
of course,

111
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.950
what it will do is just simply crop
off the part that doesn't display.

112
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.420
Which is totally fine,
you're not really loosing anything.

113
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.410
And then in mobile dimensions
it doesn't display at all.

114
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.660
And then down here on the bottom,
of course, I've just got some little boxes

115
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.230
based on that same grid system
that we've worked on previously.

116
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:54.050
So, are there any questions on the type
of thing that I've put together here?

117
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.950
Anybody have any questions
pertaining to Flexbox,

118
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.380
Flexbox Grid Systems,
anything else lingering from yesterday?

119
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.010
Sure, so, we had a question here
in class about min width, and

120
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.790
with Flexbox, so
Amy's question was that as

121
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.640
pages get wider and
we wind up with Flexbox doing it's thing,

122
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.640
being flexible, at some point do we need
a min width somewhere along the way?

123
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.950
And that's really a question of design,
you can do that or not, and

124
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.710
as you can see in my pages that I've built
here I've put a min width on a wrapper for

125
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:36.540
the whole page, so this particular design
can only get to 1,200 pixels wide.

126
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.800
If you were to remove that then
this page would scale indefinitely.

127
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.440
And so I made the art decision to

128
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.090
keep the size of my page to a minimum,
you don't have to do that.

129
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.900
So, I never think that's
a bad idea by the way.

130
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.580
I think that that's an art
decision that you can make

131
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.850
based on the kinds of browsers that you're
using, levels of accessibility that you

132
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.340
might need to maintain the types of
devices that you need to support.

133
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.100
There's a whole lot of factors that
would play into whether you would do

134
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.610
that or not.

135
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.900
If you were putting min width
on individual grid cells,

136
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.390
I don't necessarily think that's
the best idea in the world.

137
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.380
I think you'd probably better handles
things with the min width on an outside

138
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.130
container, but that's just my opinion.

139
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.530
I think, technically speaking,

140
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.600
there's nothing wrong with putting
that min width wherever you want.

141
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.580
Technically speaking it should work okay,
but

142
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.250
I tend to be more of a code minimalist,
and I tend to put

143
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.410
things abstracted away as far as possible,
as you just saw in that image gallery.

144
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.980
Use one class where possible rather
than repeating the same classes over

145
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.890
and over again.

146
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:53.000
Take advantage of the cascade and
inheritance in order to keep cleaner and

147
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.310
more maintainable code,
that tends to be my style.
