>> Jen Kramer: In that folder for seven wrap-up, you're gonna do the following. There is the original picture of Merilee, Merilee Wilbur, the founder of Pie in the Sky Bakery. What I'd like for you to do is to take that original picture and make three different sizes that you can use on your website.

[00:00:16]
Put them on the history.html page that you've already worked on. You recoded it in Flexbox. And then use the picture tag and picture fill in order to make that all work, okay, so you've got that image in place. Then you should be able to take the finished image gallery from the five image gallery folder and put that on another page.

[00:00:35]
Call it the gallery, the Pie in the Sky gallery. So we take that image gallery we already coded by itself. Now we're gonna drop it on into the rest of the website, okay. And if you have extra time, you're more than welcome to create a homepage, as well.

[00:00:50]
And so you're aware, there is a folder up here called Branding. In the Branding folder there are background images, fonts, examples of fonts from a PDF that I used here, a site comp, some web copy, so anything that you want here. And I'll just show you real quick what my results look like.

>> Jen Kramer: So here's my image gallery page, okay. So I chose one of my Flexbox solutions here, the neater looking of them, and dropped it in as a Pie Gallery page. Here's my History page, and Merilee's a little bit bigger, all right. And we adjusted the projector, so she's even nicer looking.

[00:01:37]
So there we go.
>> Jen Kramer: Different size pictures there from Merilee. And then I also added a homepage. And on my homepage, I got a picture of the pie buffet, and put it on up here on the top. Underneath, we've got little boxes, which I think are required by law now on all home pages, right.

[00:01:58]
And if we go ahead and scrunch this down, then you can see that we change our layouts and so forth. All right? So this'll be a good sort of exercise to end the rest of your day. And we have one question from the internet. Yes.
>> Student: Is a viewport meta tag missing that is causing the weird behavior you're seeing?

[00:02:21]

>> Jen Kramer: It could very well be. I might have done something strange there in my code. Again, I'm not too concerned because it is working in the end folder. So I'm not sure where my error is. And I don't want to take class time to figure it out.
