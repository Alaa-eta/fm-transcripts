WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
now that we've got that in place and

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.870
we have our shapes, the next thing that
we're probably interested in doing is

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.760
cleaning up these sizes a little bit.

4
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.410
What I did in the painting, kinda like
a cooking show, where Julia Child's

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.990
slides the turkey into the oven, and
says in three hours, it looks like this.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.760
And she opens the top oven and
pulls out the baked turkey.

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.230
We'll do the same thing here.

8
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.450
So what I did here with my painting

9
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.170
was I used a tool that comes with Firefox
called the web developer toolbar and

10
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.110
it's got one of those rulers on it
that measures things in pixels.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.460
You may have a similar tool, it may
not be from the web developer toolbar.

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.690
But you basically need some kind
of tool that can measure pixels.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.154
And I'll show you What mine looks like.

14
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.414
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here in Firefox,

15
00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:53.449
if I go to painting.png.

16
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:01.020
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Extra character there.

17
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.290
Okay, so the web developer toolbar
that I have plugged in is right here.

18
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.510
If you type web developer toolbar
into Google, you'll find it, it's

19
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.860
an extension from Chris Pederick and it's
available for both Chrome and Firefox.

20
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.760
It was one of the earliest web
development tools that was out there.

21
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.210
And if you go to, once you've got
the web developer toolbar in place,

22
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.830
if you go to, here's Miscellaneous,
and then Display Ruler.

23
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.240
This particular one,
you can drag this little ruler around,

24
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.370
and sort of let's make it match up here
we'll see, one of the nice things is that

25
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.520
you can blow up your image and the pixel
dimensions here are still the same.

26
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.410
So, we can drag this around and
come up with a size.

27
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.027
And, it's reporting that size up here.

28
00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:56.998
So, this is 453 by 435 pixels.

29
00:01:56.998 --> 00:02:00.966
Okay, so this is the kind of thing that
you can do with a tool like this, and

30
00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:04.540
you can measure the sizes of
these particular squares.

31
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.530
And so I went ahead and
I did all that for you.

32
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.771
You can thank me later.

33
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:14.960
[LAUGH] And then so what we're going to do
then in our CSS, we're gonna scroll back

34
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.568
on up here to the wrapper and we're gonna
introduce two more properties to this.

35
00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:24.995
One is grid-template-rows and

36
00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:31.810
the other is grid-template-columns.

37
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.630
Okay?

38
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.200
So these two properties are a way
of calling out a grid system for

39
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.970
your whole entire webpage.

40
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.860
So you can say, here to your browser,

41
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.950
I would like to create some number
of rows, some number of columns.

42
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.850
And I can give all those rows and
columns dimensions on the page, okay?

43
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.120
And I'm just gonna do this in pixels for
now.

44
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.997
There are plenty of other units that
you can use that are not pixels, but

45
00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:03.195
given the fact that we're recreating
a painting that has a very thick size and

46
00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:05.781
we're not worried about content or
anything,

47
00:03:05.781 --> 00:03:08.908
we're just going to do this
first example all in pixels.

48
00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:14.565
And then i'll introduce you to some of
those, probably much better units for

49
00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:19.090
doing website design and
development later on today.

50
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.582
So basically,
the numbers that I came up with here for

51
00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:30.442
my template rows and
template columns are as follows: so

52
00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:34.121
170 px 210 px 61px 61px.

53
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:41.070
Okay, so those will be our four rows.

54
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.010
And if you take a look at the painting,
you can see where that comes from.

55
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.120
170 for this a, 210 for this b.

56
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.590
And then the heights of f and
g are about the same.

57
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.187
About 61 pixels tall, okay?

58
00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:55.239
So that's where those come from.

59
00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.630
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

60
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.650
you can enter any sorta number in there?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

61
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.933
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And it will just keep

62
00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:04.864
knowing how many columns forever?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, so the fact that I am

63
00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:10.236
going to now call out four numbers here,
the grid system will create four rows for

64
00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:14.818
me and those are going to basically
be the heights of those rows when we

65
00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:19.500
combine it with the columns it probably
makes a little bit more sense.

66
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.367
But those are how tall
those rows are going to be,

67
00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:28.761
and then for
our columns we're going to have

68
00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:33.775
the numbers of 124 px 376 px 42 px, okay?

69
00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:38.350
So those are gonna be our three columns.

70
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.940
So you can see how those numbers
intersect to form squares on the page.

71
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.650
Now what happens if we happen to have,
we go through H, I think on this page?

72
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.160
What if we had I, J, K and L?

73
00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.520
What would happen at that point?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anyone wanna take a guess?

74
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Probably automatically

75
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.346
create a new row.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Keep creating more rows and

76
00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:12.503
more columns,
according to this sort of pattern, okay?

77
00:05:12.503 --> 00:05:17.570
Great, so then for the grid gap,
we set that up 10 px initially.

78
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.490
Change that to 30 px 20 px.

79
00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:28.720
Okay grid gap can be
specified in of course,

80
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.400
the column basis or in the row basis and
we have two numbers here.

81
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.310
You can think of this just like
we do with margins zero auto.

82
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.870
Which you've probably put
in a webpage before, right?

83
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.760
Zero is the top and the bottom.

84
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.470
Auto is the left and the right.

85
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.274
Same kinda thing here.

86
00:05:46.274 --> 00:05:50.214
30 px is the top and the bottom or
the space between the rows.

87
00:05:50.214 --> 00:05:53.630
20 px is the up and down or
the space between the columns.

88
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.205
Makes sense?

89
00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:56.800
Okay.

90
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.570
Now because this is a painting,
the exact layout here and because

91
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.220
I can't specify my grid gap precisely for
every single one of these gaps.

92
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.700
We'll be off by a few
pixels on the painting but

93
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.590
we'll be pretty close,
close enough for our purposes.

94
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.978
So if you refresh your web page,

95
00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:24.747
you should see we're
getting pretty close to

96
00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:29.475
what that is.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

97
00:06:29.475 --> 00:06:33.280
you could probably finesse those numbers
a little bit more and get it even closer.

98
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.777
But you get the idea.

99
00:06:36.777 --> 00:06:38.660
Does anybody have any
questions at this point?

100
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.050
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there any way to

101
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.130
color that grid gap or
is that just background space?

102
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What a wonderful question.

103
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.860
That was totally a plan.

104
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.311
That's the next thing
we're going to go into,

105
00:06:53.311 --> 00:06:55.282
is how we're gonna put the colors in.

106
00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:58.280
Any other questions at this point?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Without specifying

107
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.860
any additional rows,
will that take on an auto height?

108
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.010
Keeping the last value-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.

109
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: 42 pixels or

110
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.170
restart at 124 pixels?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure, let's go ahead and

111
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.750
try it.

112
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:16.870
So let's just say that we have,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

113
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.136
I'm just gonna go ahead and add some more
rows here, and I'm not gonna have any

114
00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:24.364
classes associated with them.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Or

115
00:07:24.364 --> 00:07:25.580
some more dibs I should say.

116
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.790
All right, so there is some more stuff.

117
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.331
If we were to display that.

118
00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:39.761
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we go.

119
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.380
They're showing up down
here at the bottom as lines

120
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.220
because I have no content in them.

121
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.930
So, let me just give you
a little bit of content.

122
00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:58.543
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So you can see down here at

123
00:07:58.543 --> 00:08:04.233
the very bottom of the webpage,

124
00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:13.055
there's some additional
rows that ere added.

125
00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:15.470
Those were those extra divs that I put in.

126
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.995
They're as tall as their content
which is like three letters.

127
00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.443
Okay?

128
00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:26.510
Because we didn't specify
where they're supposed to go.

129
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.240
This is again part of that
what's called the implicit grid.

130
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.290
As you start to read documentation
you'll hear about the explicit grid and

131
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.860
the implicit grid.

132
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.260
The explicit grid in this document are
the things that we've actually called out

133
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.980
dimensions for, all right.

134
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.560
The implicit grid, it's just gonna
continue on trying to fit the additional

135
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.200
items that you add according to
the pattern that you established.

136
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.720
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, cool.

137
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.840
I'm gonna go ahead and take those out
cuz we don't really actually want those.

138
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.970
Okay, so then the last part of finishing
out the painting here is this.

139
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.910
We're just gonna add a few colors.

140
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:14.687
So I'm gonna add a background color,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Of black

141
00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:20.192
to my wrapper here.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

142
00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:25.138
I'm gonna take out my background image so
you can either erase that or you can just

143
00:09:25.138 --> 00:09:32.288
comment it out.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm also gonna comment out

144
00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:37.920
the opacity of the divs, cuz I actually,
I want that one at 100% not at 50%.

145
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.472
Okay.

146
00:09:41.472 --> 00:09:44.680
And then all you have to
do is look at the painting.

147
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.050
So c is gonna be red.

148
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.750
D is gonna be blue and
g is gonna be yellow.

149
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.200
I haven’t taken the time to figure
out the exact hex color for these.

150
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.220
I’m just using red, blue, and yellow.

151
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.300
But you are certainly welcome to get
your little eye droppers out and

152
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.210
figure out exactly what
the hex colors are.

153
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:09.265
So to this,
I will simply add here on letter c,

154
00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:13.260
a background color of red.

155
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.886
On d a background-color:

156
00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:24.707
blue;
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

157
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:28.408
I'll make text white in their too because
so it'll be a little easier to see.

158
00:10:28.408 --> 00:10:30.970
And then finally on g
I'll add a background

159
00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:35.278
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Color of yellow

160
00:10:40.862 --> 00:10:42.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

161
00:10:47.745 --> 00:10:49.144
