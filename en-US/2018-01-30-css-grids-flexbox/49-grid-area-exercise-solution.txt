[00:00:00]
>> Jen Kramer: What did you wind up getting here than for your grid template areas?
>> Jen Kramer: So it's gonna be .wrapper. Yeah, bring this up a little bit.
>> Jen Kramer: So it's gonna be the .wrapper class. It's going to be grid-template-areas. And what did you get for an answer? That should look like that.

[00:00:33]

>> Speaker 2: So would it be sidebar, sidebar header header and then the next one would be sidebar sidebar article article?
>> Jen Kramer: Header, header. And then sidebar sidebar article article. Is that what you did? Okay. Let's try that. If we refresh the page. That's pretty close. It's is pretty close.

[00:01:06]

>> Jen Kramer: We could probably argue that this would actually be header, maybe an article here.
>> Jen Kramer: And just push that sidebar over just a little bit more but yeah, you're pretty close.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay, so the question was, why do we specify header four times? So, why don't we just try that?

[00:01:33]
Let's just say sidebar header and let's just say sidebar article and see what we get.
>> Jen Kramer: So if we do that, just say sidebar header and sidebar article, save that and refresh your browser. And it looks like that, it's working also, okay? And that is probably because of the way that we declared these columns up here on the top, the one and the three together, okay?

[00:02:01]
So if instead I did this, repeat 4, 1fr, right? So now I'm four, four columns, one fraction each, do you think it's still gonna work, down here with the desktop? You think it's still gonna work? How many say it's still gonna work
>> Jen Kramer: How many say no? It totally won't work.

[00:02:28]
A few more. How many say I have absolutely no idea? That's always gets the most votes. Okay, so if you go on ahead and save that and refresh the page. So this is what you get.
>> Jen Kramer: All right. So, the combination then, so here where we had just said four columns of one fraction each, then it becomes important to specify header header and article article, okay?

[00:03:06]
So, then it becomes important to specify those, right? So that we get correct layout or we need to spell out our column like this, 1fr, 4fr and then down here in our desktop dimension. Again, we could just say, sidebar header. Sidebar article. And those will correspond with those columns above.

[00:03:39]

>> Jen Kramer: Make sense?
>> Jen Kramer: Okay cuz some of you still look a little bit unnerved here, at least in class. Are you okay? It's just that post-lunch slump thing? Nap time, okay.
>> Jen Kramer: All right, any questions on that grid area stuff? We're gonna do more with it but I'm gonna hit a couple of topics in rapid succession and then we're gonna go do a longer exercise.

[00:04:14]
Okay, so that's a grid area. I'm sorry, I forgot, one more thing I have to show you with grid area. Open back up your grid area.css file. Okay, so that, oops, that should be 3fr. Here's another piece of syntax that you can use with grid area. So, let's say that I wanted to have an empty column between the side bar and the header in the article.

[00:04:48]
Okay? So just for consistency's sake, I'm going to change this back to repeat 4, 1fr. So now I have four columns, one fraction each. I have a sidebar, header header. And I have an article. Article. What I'd like to do now is I'd like to place an empty column, in between the sidebar and the header.

[00:05:17]
And an empty column between the sidebar and the article. So, the way you can do this is with the .notation. The minimum number of dots is 1. You can have more than one dot if you wish, so you could just say dot, dot, dot, that's kind of a nice way of doing it.

[00:05:33]
You can have many, many, many dots if you want. But this is going to create an empty column in the display of that page, so, if you go on ahead and save that and refresh your webpage, you should see a nice big gap here and of course, these fractions are quite large, so it's a quite large gap that we have in our layout.

[00:05:57]
Probably larger than you'd really want design wise but it's a thing that you can do here. You of course don't have to put it in the two column locations. You can simply say, I only want it here between the sidebar and the article. So, we could set that up and that will also work.

[00:06:22]

>> Jen Kramer: Okay? Makes sense? So this is something that you can do with this grid area syntax that you really are less able to do with just using grid column and grid row. If you wanted to have that empty column somewhere along that way that becomes a little more difficult.

[00:06:39]
It becomes a much easier to implement here using this grid template area syntax. Yes?
>> Speaker 3: What if we want the space to be smaller than one fraction?
>> Jen Kramer: If you want the space to be smaller than one fraction here, then what we'd need to do for our grid template columns is we need to set up some kind of different kind of thing here, let's say it's 1fr, 0.2fr, 1fr, 1fr.

[00:07:07]
Let's see what that does.
>> Jen Kramer: That may or may not work. So, it helped a little bit.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay and it will probably work better if I actually had that total to a whole number instead of 3.2 fractions for the whole page.
>> Jen Kramer: [LAUGH] But that's what I did.
