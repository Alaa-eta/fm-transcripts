>> Speaker 1: Is there any problem with using negative margin value? It seems hacky, but it seems work okay.

>> Speaker 1: Evan's like, okay, well, I don't get the more control thing still. If we're setting the exact percentage of the width and know the exact number of columns in each row setting justified content, spaced evenly has the same control as setting margins.

>> Jen Kramer: Fair enough.

>> Jen Kramer: I'm not sure space evenly as as much support as space between or space around.
>> Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not fully compatible.
>> Jen Kramer: Yeah, probably not fully compatible. In our universe, where we work with the latest version of Firefox and Chrome, it's a beautiful world.

[LAUGH] But everything works. But probably not in your regular browser stack.
