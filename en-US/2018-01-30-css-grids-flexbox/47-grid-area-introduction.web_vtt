1
00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
the next thing we're gonna talk about,

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.000
grid area, the grid template areas and
the grid area's syntax.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.960
Since I've got the document up, this is
actually a pretty easy way to explain it.

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.990
So far, we have typically used the grid
column and the grid row together

5
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.110
in a single decoration to declare
where we want to have a certain area

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.060
of our webpage designated, where that
particular grid item is going to be.

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.930
A different way that you can do
this is actually using real names.

8
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.855
So, in this particular situation, what
we would do is we could have a series of

9
00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:44.249
classes where we're gonna use a property
called grid-area, and you give it a name.

10
00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:47.887
And I've given these particular classes,
class1, 2, and

11
00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:50.633
3, I gave them names like header,
article and

12
00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:55.324
aside because presumably that's the
function that they serve in the document.

13
00:00:55.324 --> 00:00:59.576
Obviously, you can call these
grid areas anything you want,

14
00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:01.660
any name you happen to want.

15
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.970
So you can call them George, Sam, and

16
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.810
Mary if you prefer, although those
tend not to be as self documenting.

17
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.260
And then down underneath here where we
have our wrapper which would be our grid

18
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.640
container, we can declare our columns,
our rows, and

19
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.140
then we would declare
our grid template areas.

20
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.330
So if you look at this,
what I have here is two rows, and

21
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.590
the first row is header,
header, header, header.

22
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.090
In other words, since I declared
four columns here, one fraction and

23
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.590
three fractions wide, what I do here
is I say header header header header.

24
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.497
In other words, the header is going
to occupy all four of those columns,

25
00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:43.389
make sense?

26
00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:47.385
Okay, and then underneath,
I'm gonna have an aside,

27
00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:51.227
the dot is an indicator to
skip that particular cell.

28
00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:53.350
So don't display anything there.

29
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.530
And then have an article article.

30
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.931
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
in this particular situation,

31
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:03.784
those two articles will wind up
being a container with that class2.

32
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:07.461
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It makes sense?

33
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:11.110
Sort of, let's see it in action, okay?

34
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.440
So this is sort of an overview of
the syntax we're gonna talk about next,

35
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.530
this grid template areas.

36
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.917
So feel free to refer to that,

37
00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:21.756
you have your cheat sheet in front of you
people in class or in the document online.

38
00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:28.906
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
if we take a look at, we are at chapter

39
00:02:28.906 --> 00:02:34.250
12 here in the documentation or
in the files.

40
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.876
And in the begin folder, we're gonna
open up gridarea.css and gridarea.html.

41
00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:45.043
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And these next few
chapters are really short and

42
00:02:45.043 --> 00:02:51.270
very simple because I'm just demonstrating
different types of syntax here.

43
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.390
So this is probably looks familiar to you.

44
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.810
We actually had this example earlier.

45
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.340
It changes around a little bit
at the various dimensions.

46
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.960
We saw that earlier.

47
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.340
So I've taken that same example here and
you see we have the same kind of HTML.

48
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.900
So we have a div with a class of wrapper.

49
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.775
We have a header,
an article, and an aside.

50
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.860
And then in our CSS,
we have some stuff already set up here.

51
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.090
So this is the original grid syntax
that I used on this particular example.

52
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.720
We have a wrapper with our grid gap, and

53
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.500
then we have our various dimensions
called out as grid-columns and grid-rows.

54
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.524
What I'd like to do now is re-write
this using this grid area syntax.

55
00:03:40.524 --> 00:03:44.721
So I'm gonna go on ahead and
write this with you.

56
00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:51.536
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So up here at the top with
the wrapper is where we'll start which is

57
00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:55.350
our grid container,
we're going to have the following.

58
00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.304
So we're gonna just have
our grid-template-columns,

59
00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:06.536
and we're gonna have
our grid-template-rows.

60
00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:11.534
And in fact, you can't of course
call these out with however

61
00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:17.000
many numbers you want and
whatever dimensions you want to use.

62
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.050
You can also just say auto which
is what I'm gonna do here.

63
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.670
So hey grid, you figure it out.

64
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:30.404
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then here to our header, our article, and

65
00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:35.150
our aside, we're going to add
an additional property value pair.

66
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.202
So here under header,
we're going to add a grid-area.

67
00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:43.027
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody wanna
come up with a name for

68
00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:45.091
what we should call our grid-area?

69
00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:50.166
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about header?

70
00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:54.158
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not to confuse you of

71
00:04:54.158 --> 00:04:55.370
course.

72
00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.560
Just because I'm using the header selector
on line 12 from the header html tag,

73
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.030
does not mean that I have to
call the grid-area header.

74
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.440
I could call it George if I wanted to.

75
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.060
But I'm gonna call it header because
that's pretty self documenting.

76
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.590
Likewise here for the article,
I'm gonna give it a grid-area of,

77
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.780
what should we call it?

78
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Article.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Article, okay?

79
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.418
And for the aside I'm gonna
give it a grid-area of?

80
00:05:23.418 --> 00:05:25.168
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Aside.

81
00:05:25.168 --> 00:05:28.662
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Aside, okay?

82
00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:34.849
Actually, I called this one sidebar just
to throw you off, sidebar, because I can.

83
00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.414
[COUGH] Just to show you that you
can call them different things.

84
00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:42.120
Okay, so
then to the wrapper up here on the top.

85
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.390
This is now working at mobile dimensions,
okay,

86
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.350
because we're outside of all of the media
queries and we're building mobile first.

87
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.200
So this would be for our mobile dimension.

88
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.959
To our wrapper class, we're gonna add

89
00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:03.740
grid-template-areas and

90
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.700
usually the way I see this
written is as follows.

91
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.849
So you write out that property
grid-template-areas:.

92
00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.783
Then usually the way I see this
written is on the next line,

93
00:06:13.783 --> 00:06:16.203
in quotes we'll have "header".

94
00:06:19.153 --> 00:06:20.982
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In quotes "article".

95
00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:24.760
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And in quotes "sidebar".

96
00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:29.130
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: With the ; at the end.

97
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.790
So this is telling grid that we're
gonna have basically, one row,

98
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.730
one column, right?

99
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.150
We're just gonna stack these things on
top of each other at mobile dimensions.

100
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.020
We're gonna have header display first,
article display second,

101
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.900
sidebar display last.

102
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.440
Makes sense?

103
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.360
Cool.

104
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.260
So if that makes sense,
then let's go to our media queries.

105
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.180
So, here in our media query for
650 pixels,

106
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.420
we can now erase all this stuff that
we've put in here before, okay?

107
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.660
This is definitely calling out where
we want these grid cells to go,

108
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.380
but we're gonna call this out
now with different syntax.

109
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.865
So we can call this out instead,
with the wrapper.

110
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:20.435
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then we can say the following

111
00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:25.251
grid-template-columns, and

112
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:30.070
grid-template-rows, okay?

113
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.530
So in this case,
as you saw it displayed on the page,

114
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.660
we had a skinny column and
we had a fat column, right?

115
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.200
So for our columns, we have two of
those but they are of different sizes.

116
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.130
So I could call this 1fr and 3fr.

117
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.620
Makes sense?

118
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.650
So one fraction and three fractions,
just divide the page into four parts.

119
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.902
Make the right one the fat one.

120
00:07:52.902 --> 00:07:57.536
Our grid-template-rows,
we can call this auto,

121
00:07:57.536 --> 00:08:00.811
however many rows it takes, right?

122
00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:09.964
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we can
try our grid-template-areas.

123
00:08:09.964 --> 00:08:12.910
Becomes this.

124
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:20.900
Article article article sidebar, right?

125
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.150
So that'll be row one.

126
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.706
We're gonna have three fractions being the
articles, so we repeat the word article

127
00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:31.341
three times, followed by the word sidebar
to indicate that's our fourth fraction.

128
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then under that
the header occupies the whole thing.

129
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.452
"header header header header".

130
00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:41.478
Make sense?

131
00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:45.605
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And put the ; on the end.

132
00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:52.502
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,so this is
a totally different way of writing exactly

133
00:08:52.502 --> 00:08:56.991
the same, the outcome is exactly the same
as what we had before with the grid

134
00:08:56.991 --> 00:09:00.840
columns and the grid rows and
all the different classes.

135
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.100
But this time we're doing this
using the grid-area syntax, and

136
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.870
we're specifying grid-template-columns,
grid-template-rows, and

137
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.540
grid areas that go on the grid container.

138
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.330
What questions do you have at this point,
before we go into the desktop?

139
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: For the grid-template-rows,
is auto the default?

140
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.010
So do you have to define that, or can you
just leave it off and it would assume?

141
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.519
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You could
probably just leave it off and

142
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.120
it will be just fine, yeah.

143
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.241
But for sake of completeness,
here, I have left it on with auto.

144
00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:35.571
Other questions at this point in time?

145
00:09:35.571 --> 00:09:36.592
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So you have 1fr and 3fr.

146
00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:37.763
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep.

147
00:09:37.763 --> 00:09:41.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So how does that
function differently than 4fr?

148
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.266
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's
a very good question.

149
00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:52.567
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's
a very good question.

150
00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:57.172
I should probably put it in as repeat 4,
1fr's, probably.

151
00:09:59.026 --> 00:10:04.179
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This also happened to work,
this also happened to work.

152
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.710
Okay?

153
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.540
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
I don't see anything for why I did that.

154
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.190
Maybe it's just an error on my part,
my apologies.

155
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.600
Okay, so for-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Brandon's asking what are

156
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.060
the limitations of the names in the grid
areas, can I use hyphens or underscores?

157
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.777
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So far as I am aware, you
can use whatever is legal in CSS is legal

158
00:10:28.777 --> 00:10:31.900
here for grid names or grid-area names.
