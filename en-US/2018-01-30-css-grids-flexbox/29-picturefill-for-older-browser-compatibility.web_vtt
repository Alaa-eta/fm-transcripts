00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just do a quick search for
Picturefill.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.140
Visit the project site.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.080
Here we go.

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.230
Okay, so this is ScottJehl.github,io.

5
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.335
So, S C O T T J E H L,

6
00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:18.080
ScottJehl.github.io/picturefill.

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.010
And so
this is the responsive image polyfill.

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.230
So he wrote this originally and
has updated it regularly through the years

9
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.110
to make sure that it's in
sync with the picture tag.

10
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.790
And one day we won't need
the polyfill anymore.

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.990
But the purpose of this polyfill
is to make this work with,

12
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.090
the picture tag work with older browsers.

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.120
So the way to make this work is
you can download the polyfill.

14
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.637
I would recommend downloading
picturefill.min.js.

15
00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:56.660
If you don't wanna download it, I've
already given it to you in the end folder.

16
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.045
So you have Picturefill,
it's available to you there.

17
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:02.070
And you can copy that
into your begin folder.

18
00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:05.724
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then,

19
00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.053
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It will go ahead and

20
00:01:09.053 --> 00:01:11.454
tell you exactly how to
go about doing this.

21
00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:17.570
So the first thing to do, as it says,
to put this little line of code

22
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.670
which calls the JavaScript file, put it in
the head section of your HTML document.

23
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.100
So unlike a lot of JavaScript these days
that we put down just before the body tag,

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.640
this is required to make the page display.

25
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.130
So it's gonna be better placed
in the head of the document.

26
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.500
So go on ahead and paste that in.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And this will be min.js.

27
00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:47.922
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,

28
00:01:47.922 --> 00:01:51.708
and then if you need it even
more cross browser compatible,

29
00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:56.705
like the browser doesn't even know what
the picture tag is, then there is this

30
00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:01.350
little bit of HTML that you can copy
right here under recommended usage.

31
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.830
You don't have to copy the head tags but
copy everything or most everything else.

32
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.150
I'm actually going to copy
the first script tag, and

33
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.046
that will be a little bit of
JavaScript that tells the browser

34
00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:21.955
what the picture tag is.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Simple

35
00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:24.150
enough that I even
understand this JavaScript.

36
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.310
Look, document.create,
a thing called picture.

37
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.690
So that's what it's doing,
it creates a picture HTML tag.

38
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.276
And then the Picturefill JavaScript
will actually tell it what to do with

39
00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:40.720
it.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

40
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.800
then at that point that's
pretty much all you need to do.

41
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.130
Look there's the URL that I was
looking for right there, line 13.

42
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.400
So now I've added the polyfill to this.

43
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.460
There's nothing I need to tweak in the
HTML because this is the HTML the way it's

44
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.690
supposed to work, and the polyfill is
just making it cross broser compatible.

45
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.230
Makes sense?

46
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.870
Sweet, feel free to take your time and

47
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.160
read through all of the things
that he talks about in here.

48
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.560
I've used Picturefill
in a very simple way.

49
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.270
Picturefill is able to accommodate
things like retina images and

50
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.110
all kinds of other variations and
so forth.

51
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.178
There's a lot of stuff here,
have fun reading through all of it.

52
00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:28.511
But I've showed you the simplest
way to work with it.

53
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:29.140
Make sense?

54
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.720
Okay, everybody doing okay so far?

55
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.407
Mark, do we have any questions online?
&gt;&gt; Mark: No, I just pasted the link for

56
00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:44.938
the Picturefill.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, fabulous.

57
00:03:44.938 --> 00:03:49.890
Okay, so then-
&gt;&gt; Mark: There's a comment on

58
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.720
picture.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

59
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.640
&gt;&gt; Mark: The best part about picture is

60
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.080
that you can load multiple image formats.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

61
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.812
&gt;&gt; Mark: So if you provide like a WebP

62
00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:02.800
version in the tag, and Chrome
automatically will use it instead of JPEG,

63
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.960
PNG.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so yes.

64
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.130
That is absolutely true,
you can use different image formats.

65
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.620
The fact that I used all JPEGs here,
appropriate to the picture that I'm using.

66
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.910
But if you wanted to mix up
whatever GIFs and PNGs and WebP and

67
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.100
all the rest of it,
you can do that crazy stuff.
