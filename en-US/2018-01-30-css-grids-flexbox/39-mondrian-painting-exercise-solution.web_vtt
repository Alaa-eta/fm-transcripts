&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So you should have
something that looks kinda like this.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.480
Again, the right shape,
the wrong distribution of those shapes.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.400
They aren't the right heights and
widths and so forth.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.300
But you can see that the shape of
the boxes that we have specified here

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.550
match the shape of the painting.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.110
So did everybody here in the classroom,

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.540
did you manage to get an answer
that looked like that?

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.390
All the heads are nodding, okay.

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.040
So my CSS code looks something like this.

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.842
So we have a series of the row, I guess
for lack of a better term, row bands and

11
00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.243
call spans, right.

12
00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:43.040
So we have a whole series of these,
d through g.

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.410
So if anybody has any questions as
to how I got any of those numbers,

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.920
please go on ahead and ask those now.

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.570
I'm happy to talk about
those a little bit more, but

16
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.100
I think otherwise I'm just
reading you numbers, right.

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.090
You probably don't really
need me to do that for you.
