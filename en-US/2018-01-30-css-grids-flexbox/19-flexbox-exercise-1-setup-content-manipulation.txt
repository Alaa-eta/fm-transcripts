>> Jen Kramer: Here’s what I’d like for you to do. In your HTML, I want you to add a fifth row.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay? So, let me hit return a few times, so you can see what I’m doing. All right, so here’s what I’d like for you to do. I’m gonna copy row number one.

[00:00:23]

>> Jen Kramer: Just for its content and stuff. I'm gonna paste it down here at the bottom, after the end of row four. So on line 79, I'll go ahead and paste in effectively what is row one again? What I want you to do is I want you to do this as a row five.

[00:00:41]
And what we're gonna do, is we're gonna do a 1-2-1 layout. So in other words, a left column, a wider center column, and a narrow right column, okay? So we need three articles to achieve that. So you're gonna get rid of the pumpkin pie at the end. And obviously these are not the right classes.

[00:01:03]
So I'm gonna remove those as well.
>> Jen Kramer: So I want you to do the following, in this row number five that we've just created. First of all what I'd like you to do is figure out how to get it work on desktop, 1, 2, 1, okay? 1, 1, 2, 1, all right?

[00:01:28]
And then as an additional step, I want you to give some thought as to what this would look like on, let's say tablet or mobile, and the order that I'd like to have is that center column of information to be listed first. Followed by the left and right columns next to each other.

[00:01:50]

>> Jen Kramer: Okay? Do I need to draw a diagram or, yes, draw a diagram?
>> Jen Kramer: Draw a diagram.
>> Jen Kramer: Desktop dimensions, that's how I want your row to look, 1, 2, 1, okay. And then when you go to say tablet dimensions, I want it to look this way, 2 at the top, 1 and 1 underneath.

[00:02:27]
Don't rearrange your HTML.
>> Jen Kramer: See if you can do it without rearranging your HTML.
