WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:03.996
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Why are you using 44%?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Why am I using 44%?

2
00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:07.966
Because, in our first row,
where we had the four boxes,

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:14.408
I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint here.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Each

4
00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:19.644
of these boxes is 20% rise,
so 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%.

5
00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:25.758
If I combine two of these, so I've got
column one here, and column one here.

6
00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:32.822
So, 20 and 20 is 40,
don't forget the margin in between these,

7
00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:37.316
which is 4%, so it becomes 44%, okay?

8
00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:39.794
Other questions?

9
00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:44.703
[BLANK_AUDIO?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Regarding the column names,

10
00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:46.553
what does column, dash one,

11
00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:48.925
dash four [CROSSTALK] in exactly?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,

12
00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:52.626
it's gonna go from one column wide,
to four columns wide.

13
00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:56.124
That, this is my convention, and
as Peter was pointing out earlier,

14
00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:59.803
maybe it doesn't work for you,
maybe it's not understandable for you,

15
00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:01.009
that's totally okay.

16
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:02.901
You can call your classes,
whatever you want.

17
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:04.516
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So, it'll be one item

18
00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:06.929
at a certain screen with,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

19
00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:07.564
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then,

20
00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:10.300
four items wide at the greatest.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.

21
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.050
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

22
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.342
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One column wide to four

23
00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:13.228
columns wide.

24
00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:15.074
Or one column wide to two columns wide.

25
00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:20.514
That's where my numbers are coming from.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Are you

26
00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:25.933
looking for
that much margin below the first row?

27
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:29.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 4% under the first row?

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.721
Or, that would really
be a design decision.

29
00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:35.954
If you wanna have margin in between
your rows, you can certainly add that.

30
00:01:35.954 --> 00:01:39.200
I think, most float based
grid systems don't have that.

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.810
But you can certainly add that,

32
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.409
easily enough.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Can you make your style

33
00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.219
sheet visible?

34
00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.256
Trying to recall follow
the naming convention.

35
00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:50.115
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.

36
00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.098
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Put up the style sheet.

37
00:01:53.098 --> 00:01:53.839
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I mean, is that

38
00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:56.539
in the repo that we can just?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, it's in the answers.

39
00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.904
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I can just link to it?

40
00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:00.416
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, you can take a look

41
00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:03.662
at the end state, and
that's got all of the CSS in it.

42
00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:07.439
So the chapter three folder,
if you look inside of the end folder,

43
00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.499
you can take a look at what's there,
in the terms of the html, the CSS.

44
00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.078
In this particular exercise,

45
00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:17.205
what we're going to do is.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You've

46
00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:19.820
added a fifth row to your html.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I think they're

47
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.375
talking about the files.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There are no files, just

48
00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:28.054
keep working with the files that you have.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Keep

49
00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:33.082
working with the files that you have.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

50
00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:38.358
like ten minutes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So you can

51
00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:42.522
still create new classes right from this?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, absolutely,

52
00:02:42.522 --> 00:02:43.242
absolutely.

53
00:02:43.242 --> 00:02:45.210
Create new classes?

54
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.011
If you can't do it without rearranging
the HTML, feel free to rearrange the HTML.

55
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:51.891
So we have a few people
here in class get it.

56
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:54.611
I'm hoping that some of you online got it.

57
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.063
So Peter says,
he's got an answer here for us.

58
00:02:57.063 --> 00:02:58.468
So what'd you do, Peter?

59
00:02:58.468 --> 00:03:00.096
What'd you do first in your HTML?

60
00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:04.620
What did you call these classes?
&gt;&gt; Peter: What I use is sort of bootstrap

61
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.986
method of doing it.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

62
00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:11.605
&gt;&gt; Peter: So, the first one I called Col3.

63
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:13.374
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Col3, okay.

64
00:03:13.374 --> 00:03:14.494
&gt;&gt; Peter: And then,

65
00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.533
the middle one.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Uh-huh.

66
00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:19.188
&gt;&gt; Peter: I'm sorry, I called it Col3-6.

67
00:03:19.188 --> 00:03:20.273
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: three dash six.

68
00:03:20.273 --> 00:03:21.271
&gt;&gt; Peter: So there's a six going along

69
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:22.212
with it.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

70
00:03:22.212 --> 00:03:25.455
&gt;&gt; Peter: And the next one was col-6-3.

71
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.067
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: six, three, [LAUGH], okay.

72
00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:28.738
&gt;&gt; Peter: And then, you have the same for

73
00:03:28.738 --> 00:03:32.808
that one.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Col-6-3, okay.

74
00:03:32.808 --> 00:03:34.505
&gt;&gt; Peter: Sorry, three dash six.

75
00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.779
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Three dash six, okay.

76
00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.835
So, in other words,
to translate for everybody else,

77
00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:45.425
the two boxes on the left and
the right have the same class name.

78
00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:49.657
The one in the middle has
a different class name, okay?

79
00:03:49.657 --> 00:03:53.637
And then in our CSS,
what did you put where?

80
00:03:53.637 --> 00:03:56.037
&gt;&gt; Peter: So the, do you wanna start

81
00:03:56.037 --> 00:03:59.738
with the desktop or with the tablet?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure,

82
00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.746
let's start with the desktop.
&gt;&gt; Peter: Okay,

83
00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:05.837
so with the desktop I
put the col-6-3 with,

84
00:04:05.837 --> 00:04:10.375
I guess for you, it would be the col-2.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

85
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.645
&gt;&gt; Peter: So the,

86
00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:13.119
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, I'll just write it

87
00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.598
out this way to make it straight forward,
so

88
00:04:15.598 --> 00:04:16.543
it flex-0.
&gt;&gt; Peter: 0044.

89
00:04:16.543 --> 00:04:17.839
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so obviously,

90
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.920
we could combine those styles,
but okay, and then?

91
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.199
&gt;&gt; Peter: And then, I added my col-3-,6,

92
00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.915
to what would be your col-1's.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

93
00:04:27.915 --> 00:04:30.204
&gt;&gt; Peter: So that's the flex 0020%.

94
00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:32.207
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 20%, okay, so

95
00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:37.397
something like that, all right.
&gt;&gt; Peter: And then,

96
00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:42.738
I put col-3-6 in the 44% one,

97
00:04:42.738 --> 00:04:46.378
so the top.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so,

98
00:04:46.378 --> 00:04:52.590
col-3-6 would be 44%.
&gt;&gt; Peter: Yep.

99
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.391
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

100
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:57.919
&gt;&gt; Peter: And the -6-3,

101
00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.818
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep.

102
00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:02.029
&gt;&gt; Peter: Would go with the others-

103
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:03.289
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Would be the 92%?

104
00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.214
&gt;&gt; Peter: Yep.

105
00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:04.793
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

106
00:05:04.793 --> 00:05:08.001
&gt;&gt; Peter: And then, I also gave col-6-3,

107
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:12.626
a order of negative one.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Tricky.

108
00:05:12.626 --> 00:05:13.569
&gt;&gt; Peter: To put it at the front,

109
00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:14.764
no matter what.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so

110
00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:16.870
it'll be at the front, no matter what.

111
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.393
So this is the basically,
the class of the fat box in the middle.

112
00:05:21.393 --> 00:05:24.604
The content box,
the way I'm thinking of it.

113
00:05:24.604 --> 00:05:29.823
He's put in a negative order one, so that
will show up at the front of the list.

114
00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:35.486
Col three hyphen three hyphen six,
which is left or right ends.

115
00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:40.093
That has no order to it, so
it will follow after, okay?

116
00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:43.773
Great, and then what?
&gt;&gt; Peter: I did one last thing.

117
00:05:43.773 --> 00:05:44.766
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

118
00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:46.731
&gt;&gt; Peter: It wasn't working well

119
00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:48.106
on my computer so

120
00:05:48.106 --> 00:05:51.053
I gave this media query a limit.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

121
00:05:51.053 --> 00:05:52.382
&gt;&gt; Peter: So it has a minimum width,

122
00:05:52.382 --> 00:05:53.568
right now.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

123
00:05:53.568 --> 00:05:55.800
&gt;&gt; Peter: But I also wrote in, and

124
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.596
max width.
&gt;&gt; Peter: Of 767 pixels.

125
00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:07.103
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Like that, okay.

126
00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:11.404
So, here we've limited this
particular media query.

127
00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.766
So in other words,

128
00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:17.456
the styles that are here deactivate
when we get to desktop sizes.

129
00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:20.983
So let's test, and see how that works.

130
00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:25.851
If we refresh the page,
here's the row on the bottom.

131
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:28.166
And I don't have it in color,

132
00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:33.181
because I haven't specified the styles,
but we could do that.

133
00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:39.980
And then, when I shrink it down, here
we go, we get to my right break point.

134
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.138
So you see now, Boston cream pie, which
is in the middle is now on the top and

135
00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:47.388
coconut cream pie and
pie are underneath, okay?

136
00:06:47.388 --> 00:06:50.314
And presumably,
as I shrink it down even further,

137
00:06:50.314 --> 00:06:53.182
then these guys are just gonna stack and
be happy.

138
00:06:53.182 --> 00:06:56.959
Stacked in of course,
the order that the HTML was placed in.

139
00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:04.165
Now, so the way Peter had to make this
work was he added this max width of 767.

140
00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:08.990
Can anyone think of a way that
we could make this work without

141
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.219
changing the media query?

142
00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.525
Anyone have a suggestion on that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: In the desktop

143
00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:15.487
styles?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Uh-huh.

144
00:07:15.487 --> 00:07:17.175
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You could reset the order

145
00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:18.359
number.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could

146
00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:21.377
reset the order number
in the desktop styles.

147
00:07:21.377 --> 00:07:27.269
So instead of, limiting our media query
here, which is completely legitimate.

148
00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:30.923
And you can totally go ahead and
use a range like this.

149
00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:35.205
But if it might be awkward to
do that if you've already got

150
00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:39.946
a page existing that relies on
just the min-width being true.

151
00:07:39.946 --> 00:07:44.621
You can do something different, which will
be to come down here to these classes,

152
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:46.668
six-three, and the three-six.

153
00:07:46.668 --> 00:07:50.439
And what would you recommend for that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I set it to zero.

154
00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:51.399
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just a zero?

155
00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.780
And both of these to zero?

156
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.110
Or one of them to zero?.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I only had to play with

157
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.346
the one.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You only had to play

158
00:07:57.346 --> 00:07:57.881
with the one.

159
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:01.782
So here, we set column,
hyphen, six hyphen, three,

160
00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:06.183
the fat one in the middle,
we set that to a negative one, here.

161
00:08:06.183 --> 00:08:12.184
So down here at the bottom, we can set
our order on that same class to zero.

162
00:08:12.184 --> 00:08:17.480
And then that should preserve the desktop

163
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.024
order here, as we scrunch this up.

164
00:08:22.024 --> 00:08:26.603
So, there we go with the pies
stacked on top of each other.

165
00:08:26.603 --> 00:08:30.711
And then,
when we scrunch it down even further,

166
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:35.429
there they go, one, two,
three, stacked all on top.

167
00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:39.839
Now, that is a kind of reordering
that would simply not be possible

168
00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:41.506
with the floats, okay?

169
00:08:41.506 --> 00:08:43.646
Or possible with a great
deal of Math perhaps.

170
00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:46.572
But to be able to pull out
these items within a row, and

171
00:08:46.572 --> 00:08:49.316
then make them appear in
whatever order you want.

172
00:08:49.316 --> 00:08:53.846
It's really, really powerful and
it' so simple.

173
00:08:53.846 --> 00:08:55.540
So, that's a really great trick to have.
