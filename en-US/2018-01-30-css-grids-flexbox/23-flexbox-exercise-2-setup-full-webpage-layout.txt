>> Jen Kramer: The next thing to do is to take this real world, now that we've done all this work on pie. What I'd like for you to do next is the following, we're gonna move on here to folder number four.
>> Jen Kramer: And this is gonna be an exercise that,

Those are bad colors. So if you take a look at this, this is actually laid out currently using floats. So this is a full webpage that's laid out with floats. And what I'd like for you to do now is I'd like for you to take the, basically the grid system that you just wrote with flex box and I'd like you to apply it to this particular webpage.
