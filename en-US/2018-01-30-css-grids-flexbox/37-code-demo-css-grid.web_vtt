1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we're gonna be working
with some paintings by Piet Mondrian.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.420
And you may not be familiar with him.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.230
He's a Dutch painter.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.570
He painted these paintings
around the 1930's.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.420
And in the background of these women
here is an example of his painting.

6
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.200
If you can imagine those are red,
green or, I'm sorry, red, yellow and

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.350
blue blocks, along with white
blocks with the black borders.

8
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.270
You've probably seen this
pattern somewhere out there.

9
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.503
And then is Yves St. Laurent,

10
00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:31.030
the dress designer in the 60s, decided
to make dresses based on the paintings.

11
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.270
I just love this picture.

12
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.750
So [LAUGH] we're gonna
actually go ahead and

13
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.610
recreate some of Mondrian's paintings
using CSS grid, cuz why not right?

14
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.340
Okay.

15
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.430
So I'm going to do one of these with you,
and

16
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.980
then you're going to do
one of these on your own.

17
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.038
So go on ahead and
open up in Chapter Nine.

18
00:00:54.973 --> 00:00:59.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Go to Chapter Nine and
go on ahead and open up the begin folder.

19
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.988
We're going to open up index at HTML.

20
00:01:01.988 --> 00:01:09.201
And painting.css and
did I forget to distribute the picture?

21
00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.850
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The painting
is just in the wrong place.

22
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.541
So I think the painting is outside
of the beginning and end folders so

23
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:23.711
you'll probably wanna drag either fix
the path or drag it into that folder.

24
00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:32.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flexbox, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.248
Go to grid, and
we'll go to Mondrian painting,

26
00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:41.063
and we'll go to put the painting
into the begin folder.

27
00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:49.444
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then if you were
to open the HTML here into a browser,

28
00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:53.798
once you've moved that painting image,
so people on the Internet,

29
00:01:53.798 --> 00:01:58.870
apologize, I put the painting picture
in the wrong place for the URL.

30
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.940
Just go ahead and
move it into the begin folder.

31
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.150
And that'll get you started.

32
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.090
So what we've got going on here is,
[COUGH] we have Mondrian's painting here.

33
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.630
And I have gone ahead and labeled each
of these squares with a letter, okay?

34
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.090
So that you have a sense
of what we're trying to do.

35
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.845
And you'll see that in our html
those letters correspond to these

36
00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:25.940
divs also with letters.

37
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.150
All right?

38
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.770
So what we're gonna do is, we are gonna
try to match these two things together.

39
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.670
So I've given you a starting
wrapper 600 by 600 pixels,

40
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.630
I've given you the background image here,
and the divs are in place.

41
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.280
I've outlined them in black so
that they show up a little bit better, and

42
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.660
given them a little bit of opacity.

43
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.940
So have a background image with these
divs on top of it that are opaque so

44
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.650
that we can kind of see
the painting behind the divs.

45
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.050
So we can work online and
things up correctly.

46
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.630
Make sense?

47
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.690
Okay.

48
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.245
So, here is the next thing I like for
you to do.

49
00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:11.820
[COUGH] So, what we're gonna is
we're gonna start with very simply

50
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.320
let's just get these boxes,
put them in the right shapes and

51
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.380
what I mean by that is,
if we look at just a,

52
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.690
b, and c here in the painting,
let's see if we can get a and

53
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.510
b stacked on top of each other
with a big box of c next to it.

54
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.270
Don't worry about the proportions
at this point okay,

55
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.260
don't worry about the a being skinny,
and the c being fatter.

56
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.400
Let's just get two boxes stacked on top
of each other next to a larger box.

57
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.950
Alright?

58
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.210
Make sense?

59
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.480
We're going to code this together.

60
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.860
So what do I need to do to get
started here with this painting?

61
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.630
What is the first thing
that I should type in?

62
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Display grid?

63
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display grid.

64
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:57.860
And where is that going to go?

65
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Wrapper?

66
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.815
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: On the wrapper, exactly.

67
00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:09.324
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display grid, always a good
start [COUGH] And if you wanna have

68
00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:14.611
a grid-gap just sort of as a place holder,
you can go ahead and

69
00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:20.100
do that for now, grid-gap, and
just set it up for ten pixels.

70
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.650
That's not the right number,
ultimately, but just as a place holder.

71
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.940
Just go on ahead and put that in place.

72
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.440
Okay.

73
00:04:28.784 --> 00:04:31.020
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
looking at this painting again.

74
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.159
A, B and C, what are the numbers
that I'm going to need to put in for

75
00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.840
grid rows and grid columns for A, B and C?

76
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.970
So I'm wanna let you think about that for
just a moment and

77
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.808
I'm gonna give you the hint that
the values here are gonna be

78
00:04:50.808 --> 00:04:55.880
grade-row and grade-column.

79
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.822
We're gonna need those values for
a, b and c.

80
00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:04.482
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And for
all the other ones for that matter.

81
00:05:09.607 --> 00:05:12.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But now we need to
think about what the numbers are.

82
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.030
[COUGH] So
what is the best way to start with that?

83
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.130
If we look at this.

84
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.755
How many overall columns and
rows do we have in this painting?

85
00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:26.780
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The black,

86
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.310
the black areas here are going to wind up
being the grid gap so don't count them.

87
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.830
What do you think?

88
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is it,
is it three rows and three columns?

89
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.410
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Three rows and
three columns.

90
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.760
So, we have one row here.

91
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.180
That's a.

92
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.070
Okay.

93
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.050
We have one row here.

94
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.040
That's b.
We have a row here.

95
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.810
It looks like a d, but
then what happens over here on the side?

96
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.720
F and g, right?

97
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.420
So it splits.

98
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.280
This is actually like four rows, right?

99
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.560
Four rows.

100
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.110
How many columns do we have?

101
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Three.

102
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.380
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Three, right?

103
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.430
So ABD is one column, sort of C and
E is the second column,

104
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.260
and FG with the C over top of it,
that's the third column, make sense?

105
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.830
Okay, so filing that away.

106
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.690
What would our numbers be then to
specify where A is here in this grid?

107
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.506
What are the numbers that I would type in
for the grid row and the grid column for

108
00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:28.044
letter A?

109
00:06:31.614 --> 00:06:37.729
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is it 1/4 for
the row and then 1/3 for the column?

110
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.160
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay so you are saying
1/4 for the row and 1/3 for the column.

111
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.106
Where are you getting that from?

112
00:06:50.106 --> 00:06:52.940
For the row, 1/4.

113
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was just thinking we were
starting in the upper left hand corner, so

114
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.790
it would be in the first column and
also in the first row.

115
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.

116
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And we already know
how many rows and columns we have.

117
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So that's where it is.

118
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.880
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so a is actually
gonna go from one, which is right here,

119
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.500
just over the top of a, right, to two,
which is here, between a and b.

120
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.129
Three is gonna be here between b and d.

121
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.863
And four will be here after d.

122
00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:23.974
Makes sense?

123
00:07:23.974 --> 00:07:28.650
And then with the columns one
is over here in the side.

124
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.570
Two ones are being here between b and c.

125
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.160
Three ones appear between e and
the f, g pair.

126
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.910
And then four is over here on the outside.

127
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.210
Makes sense?

128
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.880
Okay, so what would our
numbers be then for letter a?

129
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.780
For the column?

130
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.664
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: 1 to 2.

131
00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:51.988
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 1/2 right, 1/2.

132
00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:57.990
And then for the grid column,
what would it be here for a?

133
00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:02.967
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Same?

134
00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:03.816
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The same, right?

135
00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:08.071
So 1/2 and 1/2, okay?

136
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.846
How about letter b?

137
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:13.954
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Be the same column?

138
00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:17.872
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's the same column,
right, so it's still 1/2.

139
00:08:23.224 --> 00:08:24.411
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
but what about the row?

140
00:08:28.544 --> 00:08:29.157
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: 2/3?

141
00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:30.245
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2/3, right?

142
00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:34.116
So 2 to 3, okay, so 2/3.

143
00:08:38.933 --> 00:08:40.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

144
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.560
Good.
All right, now how about letter c?

145
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:50.132
What about its column value?

146
00:08:50.132 --> 00:08:55.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Justin 2/4.

147
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.420
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Two slash four,
good job, Justin.

148
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.455
So two to three three to four, so

149
00:09:01.455 --> 00:09:06.393
2/4 would be the column value,

150
00:09:06.393 --> 00:09:11.050
oops 2/4 and

151
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.940
the row for c.

152
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: 1 to 3, 1/3.

153
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.941
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So from 1 to 2 to 3 right,
so 1/3 for the row.

154
00:09:25.734 --> 00:09:28.854
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, [COUGH] so
if we just go on ahead and

155
00:09:28.854 --> 00:09:32.461
take a look at our layout so
far, we get this.

156
00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:37.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Who's a little weirded out?

157
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.340
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody a little
weirded out by that result?

158
00:09:47.816 --> 00:09:49.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anyone have any
idea what's going on here?

159
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: I just have a question?

160
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Why is C for the grid row?

161
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.730
Why isn't it 2 slash 3 for the grid row?

162
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.415
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: For the grid row?

163
00:10:00.415 --> 00:10:01.471
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Yeah.

164
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:03.826
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because
it starts here at 1.

165
00:10:03.826 --> 00:10:04.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Okay.

166
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.530
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It goes to 2.

167
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.195
2 would be somewhere in here, right?

168
00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:09.027
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Okay.

169
00:10:09.027 --> 00:10:10.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then from here, 2 to 3.

170
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.375
Okay.

171
00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:12.169
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Okay?

172
00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:13.716
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right.

173
00:10:13.716 --> 00:10:14.696
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Cool.
Thank you.

174
00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:16.210
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

175
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.630
Okay, so
here's what's going on here with grid.

176
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:25.210
Grid is very, very smart and it tries to
anticipate what you're trying to do, okay.

177
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.470
So grid knows based on
the numbers that you've typed in

178
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.590
that it there are three columns in
existence here, okay, so it knows that.

179
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.600
This is called the implicit grid, so

180
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.090
it is very helpfully constructed
three columns on this, alright.

181
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.550
It knows that there are at least two rows

182
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.590
in existence because we have a and
b in those rows okay?

183
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.390
But Grid also knows that we have boxes d,
e, f, and g,

184
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.570
and we haven't said where those
are going to be placed yet.

185
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:06.010
So Grid is going to be very smart and
say you must want three columns.

186
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.490
And you want some more rows.

187
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.590
And I'm just gonna make more rows
that are three columns each, and

188
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:17.370
put something in each one of those
columns until I run out of stuff, okay.

189
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.260
So that's called the implicit grid.

190
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.670
By implying what we're looking for
with our first three values here,

191
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:29.080
grid is continuing to construct
the layout going down the page.

192
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.830
All right?

193
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.970
So that's where those things
are going to be by default.

194
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.640
That's probably not where we want them.

195
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:41.430
We are going to need to get more explicit
about where we want D, E and F to go.

196
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.010
Make sense?

197
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.160
Okay.
And for

198
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.000
those of you who are bothered
by the fact that a, b and

199
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.810
c don't line up perfectly,
that's totally okay.

200
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.875
The shape is good,

201
00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:57.345
we're gonna get to exactly how those
are gonna line up perfectly momentarily.
