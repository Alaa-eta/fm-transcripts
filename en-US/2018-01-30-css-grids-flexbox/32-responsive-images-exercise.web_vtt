00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In that folder for seven
wrap-up, you're gonna do the following.

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.860
There is the original picture of Merilee,
Merilee Wilbur,

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.830
the founder of Pie in the Sky Bakery.

4
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.730
What I'd like for you to do is to
take that original picture and

5
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.190
make three different sizes that
you can use on your website.

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.240
Put them on the history.html page
that you've already worked on.

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.390
You recoded it in Flexbox.

8
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.560
And then use the picture tag and picture
fill in order to make that all work, okay,

9
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.610
so you've got that image in place.

10
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.200
Then you should be able to take
the finished image gallery from the five

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.500
image gallery folder and
put that on another page.

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.412
Call it the gallery,
the Pie in the Sky gallery.

13
00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.690
So we take that image gallery
we already coded by itself.

14
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.626
Now we're gonna drop it on into
the rest of the website, okay.

15
00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:46.953
And if you have extra time,

16
00:00:46.953 --> 00:00:50.290
you're more than welcome to
create a homepage, as well.

17
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.345
And so you're aware,
there is a folder up here called Branding.

18
00:00:55.345 --> 00:01:00.205
In the Branding folder there
are background images, fonts,

19
00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:04.784
examples of fonts from a PDF
that I used here, a site comp,

20
00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:08.540
some web copy, so
anything that you want here.

21
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.331
And I'll just show you real
quick what my results look

22
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:17.129
like.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

23
00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:21.602
here's my image gallery page, okay.

24
00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:26.430
So I chose one of my Flexbox solutions
here, the neater looking of them, and

25
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.390
dropped it in as a Pie Gallery page.

26
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.010
Here's my History page, and
Merilee's a little bit bigger, all right.

27
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.930
And we adjusted the projector,
so she's even nicer looking.

28
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.401
So there we go.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Different size pictures

29
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:43.680
there from Merilee.

30
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.390
And then I also added a homepage.

31
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.470
And on my homepage,
I got a picture of the pie buffet, and

32
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.280
put it on up here on the top.

33
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.410
Underneath, we've got little boxes,

34
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.400
which I think are required by law
now on all home pages, right.

35
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.370
And if we go ahead and scrunch this down,

36
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.010
then you can see that we change
our layouts and so forth.

37
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.510
All right?

38
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.880
So this'll be a good sort of exercise
to end the rest of your day.

39
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.550
And we have one question
from the internet.

40
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.750
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Student: Is a viewport

41
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.950
meta tag missing that is causing
the weird behavior you're seeing?

42
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It could very well be.

43
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.910
I might have done something
strange there in my code.

44
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.310
Again, I'm not too concerned because
it is working in the end folder.

45
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.543
So I'm not sure where my error is.

46
00:02:34.543 --> 00:02:36.380
And I don't want to take
class time to figure it out.
