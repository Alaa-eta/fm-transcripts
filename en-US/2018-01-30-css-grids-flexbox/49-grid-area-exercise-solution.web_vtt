00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.507
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What did you
wind up getting here than for

2
00:00:02.507 --> 00:00:04.088
your grid template areas?

3
00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:13.750
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So it's gonna be .wrapper.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.936
Yeah, bring this up a little bit.

5
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.065
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
it's gonna be the .wrapper class.

6
00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:26.920
It's going to be grid-template-areas.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.160
And what did you get for an answer?

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.870
That should look like that.

9
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So would it be sidebar,
sidebar header header and

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.019
then the next one would be
sidebar sidebar article article?

11
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.640
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Header, header.

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.120
And then sidebar sidebar article article.

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.800
Is that what you did?

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.840
Okay.
Let's try that.

15
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.210
If we refresh the page.

16
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.730
That's pretty close.

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.368
It's is pretty close.

18
00:01:06.183 --> 00:01:11.109
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could probably argue
that this would actually be header,

19
00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.051
maybe an article here.

20
00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:19.615
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And just push that sidebar
over just a little bit more but yeah,

21
00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:21.072
you're pretty close.

22
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:30.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so the question was,
why do we specify header four times?

23
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.290
So, why don't we just try that?

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.777
Let's just say sidebar header and
let's just say sidebar article and

25
00:01:36.777 --> 00:01:37.498
see what we get.

26
00:01:41.332 --> 00:01:45.572
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So if we do that, just
say sidebar header and sidebar article,

27
00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.060
save that and refresh your browser.

28
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.790
And it looks like that,
it's working also, okay?

29
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.624
And that is probably because of the way
that we declared these columns up here on

30
00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:01.401
the top, the one and
the three together, okay?

31
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:05.677
So if instead I did this,

32
00:02:05.677 --> 00:02:10.369
repeat 4, 1fr, right?

33
00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.845
So now I'm four, four columns,
one fraction each,

34
00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:18.110
do you think it's still gonna work,
down here with the desktop?

35
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.850
You think it's still gonna work?

36
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.070
How many say it's still gonna work
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many say no?

37
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.950
It totally won't work.

38
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.960
A few more.

39
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.090
How many say I have absolutely no idea?

40
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.560
That's always gets the most votes.

41
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.460
Okay, so if you go on ahead and
save that and refresh the page.

42
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.451
So this is what you get.

43
00:02:44.103 --> 00:02:44.870
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right.

44
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.952
So, the combination then, so here where

45
00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:56.197
we had just said four
columns of one fraction each,

46
00:02:56.197 --> 00:03:01.572
then it becomes important
to specify header

47
00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:06.710
header and article article, okay?

48
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.190
So, then it becomes important
to specify those, right?

49
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.826
So that we get correct layout or
we need to spell

50
00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:20.883
out our column like this, 1fr,

51
00:03:20.883 --> 00:03:26.970
4fr and
then down here in our desktop dimension.

52
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.150
Again, we could just say, sidebar header.

53
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.010
Sidebar article.

54
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.530
And those will correspond
with those columns above.

55
00:03:39.957 --> 00:03:40.467
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make sense?

56
00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.871
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay cuz some of you
still look a little bit unnerved here,

57
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:50.920
at least in class.

58
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.530
Are you okay?

59
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.920
It's just that post-lunch slump thing?

60
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.344
Nap time, okay.

61
00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:02.039
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
any questions on that grid area stuff?

62
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.669
We're gonna do more with it but
I'm gonna hit a couple of topics in rapid

63
00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.320
succession and
then we're gonna go do a longer exercise.

64
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.248
Okay, so that's a grid area.

65
00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:25.829
I'm sorry, I forgot, one more thing
I have to show you with grid area.

66
00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:29.400
Open back up your grid area.css file.

67
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.200
Okay, so that, oops, that should be 3fr.

68
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.160
Here's another piece of syntax
that you can use with grid area.

69
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.560
So, let's say that I wanted to have
an empty column between the side bar and

70
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.220
the header in the article.

71
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.720
Okay?

72
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:59.190
So just for consistency's sake, I'm going
to change this back to repeat 4, 1fr.

73
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.590
So now I have four columns,
one fraction each.

74
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.240
I have a sidebar, header header.

75
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.770
And I have an article.

76
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.740
Article.

77
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.540
What I'd like to do now is I'd
like to place an empty column,

78
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.460
in between the sidebar and the header.

79
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.830
And an empty column between
the sidebar and the article.

80
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.750
So, the way you can do this
is with the .notation.

81
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.600
The minimum number of dots is 1.

82
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.800
You can have more than one dot if you
wish, so you could just say dot, dot, dot,

83
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.890
that's kind of a nice way of doing it.

84
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.270
You can have many, many,
many dots if you want.

85
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.840
But this is going to create an empty
column in the display of that page,

86
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.030
so, if you go on ahead and
save that and refresh your webpage,

87
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.490
you should see a nice big gap here and of
course, these fractions are quite large,

88
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.810
so it's a quite large gap
that we have in our layout.

89
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.670
Probably larger than you'd
really want design wise but

90
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.140
it's a thing that you can do here.

91
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.140
You of course don't have to put
it in the two column locations.

92
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.530
You can simply say, I only want it here
between the sidebar and the article.

93
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.241
So, we could set that up and
that will also work.

94
00:06:22.218 --> 00:06:23.298
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

95
00:06:23.298 --> 00:06:25.290
Makes sense?

96
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.280
So this is something that you can do with
this grid area syntax that you really

97
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.280
are less able to do with just
using grid column and grid row.

98
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.230
If you wanted to have that empty
column somewhere along that way that

99
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.176
becomes a little more difficult.

100
00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:44.250
It becomes a much easier to implement here
using this grid template area syntax.

101
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.369
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What if we want the space

102
00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:49.625
to be smaller than one fraction?

103
00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:54.282
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you want the space
to be smaller than one fraction here,

104
00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:59.034
then what we'd need to do for
our grid template columns is we

105
00:06:59.034 --> 00:07:03.500
need to set up some kind of
different kind of thing here,

106
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.522
let's say it's 1fr, 0.2fr, 1fr, 1fr.

107
00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:08.900
Let's see what that does.

108
00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:12.395
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That may or may not work.

109
00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:16.378
So, it helped a little bit.

110
00:07:19.912 --> 00:07:23.221
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay and it will probably
work better if I actually had that total

111
00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:26.602
to a whole number instead of 3.2
fractions for the whole page.

112
00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:31.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [LAUGH] But
that's what I did.
