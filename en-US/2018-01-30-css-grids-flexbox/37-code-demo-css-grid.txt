[00:00:00]
>> Jen Kramer: So we're gonna be working with some paintings by Piet Mondrian. And you may not be familiar with him. He's a Dutch painter. He painted these paintings around the 1930's. And in the background of these women here is an example of his painting. If you can imagine those are red, green or, I'm sorry, red, yellow and blue blocks, along with white blocks with the black borders.

[00:00:20]
You've probably seen this pattern somewhere out there. And then is Yves St. Laurent, the dress designer in the 60s, decided to make dresses based on the paintings. I just love this picture. So [LAUGH] we're gonna actually go ahead and recreate some of Mondrian's paintings using CSS grid, cuz why not right?

[00:00:41]
Okay. So I'm going to do one of these with you, and then you're going to do one of these on your own. So go on ahead and open up in Chapter Nine.
>> Jen Kramer: Go to Chapter Nine and go on ahead and open up the begin folder. We're going to open up index at HTML.

[00:01:01]
And painting.css and did I forget to distribute the picture?
>> Jen Kramer: The painting is just in the wrong place. So I think the painting is outside of the beginning and end folders so you'll probably wanna drag either fix the path or drag it into that folder.
>> Jen Kramer: Flexbox, I'm sorry.

[00:01:32]
Go to grid, and we'll go to Mondrian painting, and we'll go to put the painting into the begin folder.
>> Jen Kramer: And then if you were to open the HTML here into a browser, once you've moved that painting image, so people on the Internet, apologize, I put the painting picture in the wrong place for the URL.

[00:01:58]
Just go ahead and move it into the begin folder. And that'll get you started. So what we've got going on here is, [COUGH] we have Mondrian's painting here. And I have gone ahead and labeled each of these squares with a letter, okay? So that you have a sense of what we're trying to do.

[00:02:20]
And you'll see that in our html those letters correspond to these divs also with letters. All right? So what we're gonna do is, we are gonna try to match these two things together. So I've given you a starting wrapper 600 by 600 pixels, I've given you the background image here, and the divs are in place.

[00:02:45]
I've outlined them in black so that they show up a little bit better, and given them a little bit of opacity. So have a background image with these divs on top of it that are opaque so that we can kind of see the painting behind the divs. So we can work online and things up correctly.

[00:02:59]
Make sense? Okay. So, here is the next thing I like for you to do. [COUGH] So, what we're gonna is we're gonna start with very simply let's just get these boxes, put them in the right shapes and what I mean by that is, if we look at just a, b, and c here in the painting, let's see if we can get a and b stacked on top of each other with a big box of c next to it.

[00:03:29]
Don't worry about the proportions at this point okay, don't worry about the a being skinny, and the c being fatter. Let's just get two boxes stacked on top of each other next to a larger box. Alright? Make sense? We're going to code this together. So what do I need to do to get started here with this painting?

[00:03:50]
What is the first thing that I should type in?
>> Speaker 2: Display grid?
>> Jen Kramer: Display grid. And where is that going to go?
>> Speaker 3: Wrapper?
>> Jen Kramer: On the wrapper, exactly.
>> Jen Kramer: Display grid, always a good start [COUGH] And if you wanna have a grid-gap just sort of as a place holder, you can go ahead and do that for now, grid-gap, and just set it up for ten pixels.

[00:04:20]
That's not the right number, ultimately, but just as a place holder. Just go on ahead and put that in place. Okay.
>> Jen Kramer: So looking at this painting again. A, B and C, what are the numbers that I'm going to need to put in for grid rows and grid columns for A, B and C?

[00:04:41]
So I'm wanna let you think about that for just a moment and I'm gonna give you the hint that the values here are gonna be grade-row and grade-column. We're gonna need those values for a, b and c.
>> Jen Kramer: And for all the other ones for that matter.
>> Jen Kramer: But now we need to think about what the numbers are.

[00:05:12]
[COUGH] So what is the best way to start with that? If we look at this. How many overall columns and rows do we have in this painting?
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Jen Kramer: The black, the black areas here are going to wind up being the grid gap so don't count them.

[00:05:30]
What do you think?
>> Speaker 4: Is it, is it three rows and three columns?
>> Jen Kramer: Three rows and three columns. So, we have one row here. That's a. Okay. We have one row here. That's b. We have a row here. It looks like a d, but then what happens over here on the side?

[00:05:52]
F and g, right? So it splits. This is actually like four rows, right? Four rows. How many columns do we have?
>> Speaker 3: Three.
>> Jen Kramer: Three, right? So ABD is one column, sort of C and E is the second column, and FG with the C over top of it, that's the third column, make sense?

[00:06:14]
Okay, so filing that away. What would our numbers be then to specify where A is here in this grid? What are the numbers that I would type in for the grid row and the grid column for letter A?
>> Speaker 3: Is it 1/4 for the row and then 1/3 for the column?

[00:06:38]

>> Jen Kramer: Okay so you are saying 1/4 for the row and 1/3 for the column. Where are you getting that from? For the row, 1/4.
>> Speaker 3: I was just thinking we were starting in the upper left hand corner, so it would be in the first column and also in the first row.

[00:07:00]

>> Jen Kramer: Correct.
>> Speaker 3: And we already know how many rows and columns we have.
>> Jen Kramer: Right.
>> Speaker 3: So that's where it is.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay, so a is actually gonna go from one, which is right here, just over the top of a, right, to two, which is here, between a and b.

[00:07:18]
Three is gonna be here between b and d. And four will be here after d. Makes sense? And then with the columns one is over here in the side. Two ones are being here between b and c. Three ones appear between e and the f, g pair. And then four is over here on the outside.

[00:07:38]
Makes sense? Okay, so what would our numbers be then for letter a? For the column?
>> Speaker 5: 1 to 2.
>> Jen Kramer: 1/2 right, 1/2. And then for the grid column, what would it be here for a?
>> Speaker 5: Same?
>> Jen Kramer: The same, right? So 1/2 and 1/2, okay? How about letter b?

[00:08:13]

>> Speaker 6: Be the same column?
>> Jen Kramer: It's the same column, right, so it's still 1/2.
>> Jen Kramer: All right, but what about the row?
>> Speaker 6: 2/3?
>> Jen Kramer: 2/3, right? So 2 to 3, okay, so 2/3.
>> Jen Kramer: Okay? Good. All right, now how about letter c? What about its column value?

[00:08:50]

>> Speaker 7: Justin 2/4.
>> Jen Kramer: Two slash four, good job, Justin. So two to three three to four, so 2/4 would be the column value, oops 2/4 and the row for c.
>> Speaker 7: 1 to 3, 1/3.
>> Jen Kramer: So from 1 to 2 to 3 right, so 1/3 for the row.

[00:09:25]

>> Jen Kramer: Okay, [COUGH] so if we just go on ahead and take a look at our layout so far, we get this.
>> Jen Kramer: Who's a little weirded out?
>> Jen Kramer: Anybody a little weirded out by that result?
>> Jen Kramer: Anyone have any idea what's going on here?
>> Speaker 8: I just have a question?

[00:09:52]

>> Jen Kramer: Sure.
>> Speaker 8: Why is C for the grid row? Why isn't it 2 slash 3 for the grid row?
>> Jen Kramer: For the grid row?
>> [SOUND]
>> Speaker 8: Yeah.
>> Jen Kramer: Because it starts here at 1.
>> Speaker 8: Okay.
>> Jen Kramer: It goes to 2. 2 would be somewhere in here, right?

[00:10:08]

>> Speaker 8: Okay.
>> Jen Kramer: And then from here, 2 to 3. Okay.
>> Speaker 8: Okay?
>> Jen Kramer: All right.
>> Speaker 8: Cool. Thank you.
>> Jen Kramer: Yeah. Okay, so here's what's going on here with grid. Grid is very, very smart and it tries to anticipate what you're trying to do, okay. So grid knows based on the numbers that you've typed in that it there are three columns in existence here, okay, so it knows that.

[00:10:34]
This is called the implicit grid, so it is very helpfully constructed three columns on this, alright. It knows that there are at least two rows in existence because we have a and b in those rows okay? But Grid also knows that we have boxes d, e, f, and g, and we haven't said where those are going to be placed yet.

[00:11:00]
So Grid is going to be very smart and say you must want three columns. And you want some more rows. And I'm just gonna make more rows that are three columns each, and put something in each one of those columns until I run out of stuff, okay. So that's called the implicit grid.

[00:11:20]
By implying what we're looking for with our first three values here, grid is continuing to construct the layout going down the page. All right? So that's where those things are going to be by default. That's probably not where we want them. We are going to need to get more explicit about where we want D, E and F to go.

[00:11:41]
Make sense? Okay. And for those of you who are bothered by the fact that a, b and c don't line up perfectly, that's totally okay. The shape is good, we're gonna get to exactly how those are gonna line up perfectly momentarily.
