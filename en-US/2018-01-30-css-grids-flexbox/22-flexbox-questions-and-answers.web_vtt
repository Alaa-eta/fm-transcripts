00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.966
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is there any problem
with using negative margin value?

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.960
It seems hacky, but it seems work okay.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.730
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, that's pretty
much the attitude of the community,

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.140
negative margins are hacky, but
it does in fact work and it's legal.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.295
So yeah,
you could definitely use negative margins.

6
00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:21.650
I've stuck with positive margins which,
for whatever reason,

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.055
people seem happier with.

8
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:28.260
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Are there comments?

9
00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:35.649
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Evan's like, okay, well,
I don't get the more control thing still.

10
00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.899
If we're setting the exact
percentage of the width and

11
00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.208
know the exact number of columns in
each row setting justified content,

12
00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:46.539
spaced evenly has the same
control as setting margins.

13
00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You are welcome to do that.

14
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.340
Go right on ahead.

15
00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:58.706
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Raquel is saying it's not as
efficient because you're using negative to

16
00:00:58.706 --> 00:01:02.830
negate the previous style instead
of removing the previous style.

17
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Fair enough.

18
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Dale,
as long as it works with right to left.

19
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.110
I don't know what he means by that.

20
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is space evenly usable in

21
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.650
browsers today?

22
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.130
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm not sure space evenly
as as much support as space between or

23
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.310
space around.

24
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah,
it's not fully compatible.

25
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.902
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
probably not fully compatible.

26
00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:30.874
In our universe, where we work with
the latest version of Firefox and

27
00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:32.445
Chrome, it's a beautiful world.

28
00:01:32.445 --> 00:01:35.550
[LAUGH] But everything works.

29
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.746
But probably not in your
regular browser stack.
