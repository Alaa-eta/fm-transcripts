00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The next thing to
do is to take this real world,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.970
now that we've done all this work on pie.

3
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.047
What I'd like for
you to do next is the following,

4
00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:09.081
we're gonna move on here
to folder number four.

5
00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:13.850
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
this is gonna be an exercise

6
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.034
that,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me make sure I

7
00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:19.000
get the right files open.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.756
This is gonna be an exercise that is
very real world in a lot of cases.

9
00:00:28.753 --> 00:00:31.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is
the pie in the sky website.

10
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.310
The colors are horrendous
on this projector.

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.390
Trust me that they're way better on
the computer that's in front of you.

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.850
Those are bad colors.

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.770
So if you take a look at this, this is
actually laid out currently using floats.

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.910
So this is a full webpage
that's laid out with floats.

15
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.070
And what I'd like for you to do now
is I'd like for you to take the,

16
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.470
basically the grid system that
you just wrote with flex box and

17
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.830
I'd like you to apply it
to this particular webpage.

18
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.163
So you're gonna need to think
about how exactly you're gonna lay

19
00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:10.048
this out differently using your flex
box styles and classes going ahead,

20
00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:12.756
and apply them to this particular page.

21
00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:17.558
And basically, the end result
should look exactly like this, but

22
00:01:17.558 --> 00:01:23.576
it should be coded with flex box in a grid
system instead of being coded with floats.

23
00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:27.169
So that's the desktop,

24
00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:32.310
here is the sort of the tablet size.

25
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.110
We've got this guy stacked underneath,
and then finally of course is mobile,

26
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.980
all right?

27
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.600
With everything stacked
on top of each other.

28
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.640
Normally, you might go to a hamburger
button here on the navigation.

29
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.610
In the interest of keeping JavaScript
data things, I've just gone ahead and

30
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.060
changed the order here of the navigation
to work with that fingers.

31
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.800
So let's go ahead and take like,
let's say a half an hour, sound good?

32
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.180
And go ahead and hack at this page.

33
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.371
And this is all in folder number,
chapter four, and

34
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:08.098
the name if that folder is 4-pie-flexbox.

35
00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:09.834
Have fun.
