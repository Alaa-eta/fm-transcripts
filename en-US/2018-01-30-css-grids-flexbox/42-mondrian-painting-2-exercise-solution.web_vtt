1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.990
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we had our painting here, and

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.620
when I was working on this for
the answer I started to put this together.

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.490
And then it was only later that I realized
the D is actually slightly shorter than

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.070
B is.

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.880
Did anybody else get tripped up by that?

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.230
B and D are not exactly the same height.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.610
So there's an extra row in there perhaps
that you might not have factored in.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.240
That was sort of the one tricky
thing that I found about this.

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.192
So I did manage to get
mine looking like this,

10
00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:41.370
maybe yours is somewhat close to that
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No.

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.440
Kasey is shaking her head no.
&gt;&gt; Kasey: Not

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.470
yet.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not yet.

13
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.930
Okay, Kasey needs some more time and
she's totally going to get it.

14
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.000
I know Brady got it.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.870
Jackie you got it.

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.270
Did anybody else get it?

17
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.170
Amy got it.

18
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.150
Peter?
&gt;&gt; Peter: I

19
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.870
was pretty close.

20
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.470
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pretty close.

21
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.850
&gt;&gt; Peter: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Awesome.

22
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.400
Okay.

23
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.710
So here is what the answer
looked like here.

24
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.698
The HTML, basically nothing changed.

25
00:01:06.698 --> 00:01:11.140
And then in the CSS here.

26
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.400
So it's basically the same thing
that I already showed you previously

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.180
in terms of the formulas, to what types
of properties that I have in here.

28
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.950
The values are obviously different for
this particular painting.

29
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.340
So I gave you the width and the height for

30
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.280
the wrapper,
I made the font size nice and big.

31
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.470
And then we have our display grid.

32
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.720
These were the measurements that I came
up with for the grid template rows and

33
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.450
the grid template columns.

34
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.110
And your measurements might
be slightly different.

35
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.800
I don't profess to be super extra
careful as I made those measurements but

36
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.300
they're pretty close.

37
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.200
The grid gap was about five
pixels in this case, and

38
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.530
I set the background color
to black eventually.

39
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.790
And then for each one of my grid columns,
in this case it did go through.

40
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.460
Take my little eye dropper and
figure out exactly the shade of red,

41
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.810
blue and yellow that I had here, so
those values are reflected here.

42
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.540
If you just said red, blue or yellow as
your color keyword that's totally fine.

43
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.670
So you'll see here how I
setup my grid rows and

44
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.242
my grid columns pretty much as
you might expect, all right?

45
00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.019
And rather than read
you all those numbers,

46
00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.280
I'm just gonna live it open to you.

47
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.870
Is there a box that you
had trouble placing or

48
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.050
anything that I can help you with?

49
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.500
Is there anywhere along the way
that you got tripped up,

50
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.070
was it hard doing the measurements,
for example.

51
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.960
Anybody have any comments on that?

52
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.750
So, probably you all would have gotten
it with just a little bit more time.

53
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.010
It's really nice to know that you now
have this in your back pocket and

54
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.360
you can really create some
whacked out layouts with grid.

55
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.310
It's pretty amazing.

56
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.390
I think in my solution
here that my n-state for

57
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.472
number nine.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me just check this

58
00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:08.120
real quick before I start talking.

59
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.950
I did.

60
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.810
One of the things I did here for number 9.

61
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.690
And I'm going to point this
out as an interesting problem.

62
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.065
So I'm gonna go back to chapter 9
which was the painting that we coded

63
00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:25.155
together.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If I show that

64
00:03:25.155 --> 00:03:28.800
in the browser,
that was the answer that we got earlier.

65
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.400
I actually wrote some media
queries to go along with this.

66
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.810
And so with my Harvard students when we do
this, we actually take the painting and

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.500
flip it upside down and code it upside
down on a different media query.

68
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.760
Here is an interesting thing that
I've noticed about this when

69
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.080
working here in my browser.

70
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.380
As I start to narrow things down,
it doesn't look like there is any

71
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.800
responsiveness at all in
this particular painting.

72
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.970
What I actually wind up having
to do when I'm here in Firefox,

73
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.650
if you go to edit, no, no, sorry.

74
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.160
You have to right click somewhere.

75
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.410
And you go to inspect element.

76
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.330
And then what I wind up having to do is

77
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.040
showing the mobile dimensions like this,
and then you can see the media queries.

78
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.040
I'm not sure why this is, but
it seems to be the way things are.

79
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.660
And so for this media query I
flipped the painting upside,

80
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.130
I made the background color green to
show you that I actually did that.

81
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.670
So I'll just point that
out to you in the CSS.

82
00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.820
So outside of the media query here, and

83
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.170
again this is chapter nine, we're back
to painting.CSS in the end state.

84
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.330
Outside of the media query is sort
of the default desktop value, so

85
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.210
this is not a mobile first design.

86
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.030
These are the desktop
values that we have here.

87
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.610
Then you have a media query here where
I've actually flipped this over.

88
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.890
And so, you can see,
I've just coded different locations for

89
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.230
those boxes in the media query.

90
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.783
And then,

91
00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:08.904
when I get down here to the bottom,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The very bottom of this,

92
00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:11.120
notice what I've done here.

93
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.610
All I did for my media query,
for the small dimension,

94
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.570
was this, I just said, display: block.

95
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.620
In other words,
I just disabled display grid altogether.

96
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.790
So I'll just have these boxes
stacked on top of each other.

97
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.520
So we're no longer
dealing with grid at all.

98
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.750
And the background color
in this case is orange.

99
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.710
Just to show you that it worked,
and if I change the dimensions here

100
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.820
in this view in Firefox, then you can
that in fact that's what happens.

101
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.930
We just had the boxes
stacked on top of each other.

102
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.810
Okay, so
this might be something to keep in mind,

103
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.640
that you may have to come in here in
order to test your various grid layouts.

104
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.260
Okay?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Question from Josiah,

105
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.710
is here any reason to not use a span?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There's absolutely no

106
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.740
reason not to use a span.

107
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.800
So one of the alternative syntaxes for
the grid template, or sorry, for

108
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.130
the grid rows and the grid columns
is to use the keyword span.

109
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.200
So like one span two or
something like that.

110
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.850
You can totally do it that way
instead of specifying the two numbers.

111
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.360
From my perspective,
they do pretty much the same thing.

112
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.710
And I'm lazy and would prefer not
to type all those extra letters.

113
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.800
But if you prefer that type of syntax,
you're more than welcome to use it.

114
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.910
My teaching philosophy on
this has always been that

115
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.290
I can really confuse everybody in the room
by throwing everything at you at once.

116
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.420
I'd rather have you focus on one syntax
and get to know it really well, and

117
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.860
then at that later point in time you can
pick up the other syntaxes really easy.

118
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.910
So an example of this is when I
teach beginners color in CSS.

119
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.700
I teach them six digit hex codes.

120
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.990
That's all we do, and then later on when
they bump into a three digit hex code or

121
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.590
an RGB or RGBA or keywords for
colors, then it's

122
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.340
a relatively simple thing to just go, it's
the same thing but presented differently.

123
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.195
In the beginning when you're trying
to settle what each property

124
00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:15.399
value pair happens to be doing,
I tend to stick to one kind of syntax and

125
00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:20.290
just hammer on that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Stacy said just a comment,

126
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:26.910
she said, I put the maximum column row
value as a note about each div selector.

127
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.510
That seemed to help
because counting is hard.

128
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, counting is hard and

129
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.350
so she did some commenting for
that, that's awesome.

130
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.540
Comments are always welcome.

131
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:43.080
I've never heard from any developer
that code is not commented enough.

132
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.640
I believe we're all guilty of
not commenting enough [LAUGH]

133
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Julian's asking why

134
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.040
don't you use that min div,

135
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.620
min device width in the media queries?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The minimum

136
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.310
device width in the media queries.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That's why the resizing

137
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.198
doesn't work normally I guess.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is that why

138
00:08:03.198 --> 00:08:04.690
the resizing doesn't work?

139
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.500
That can very well be.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Instead of just min width.

140
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.563
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So take out the device and

141
00:08:09.563 --> 00:08:10.827
then it's gonna work again,

142
00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:12.960
is what he's suggesting?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

143
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.645
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so let's try that.

144
00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:22.457
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Whoops,

145
00:08:22.457 --> 00:08:28.831
HTML.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool.

146
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.620
Thanks for that tip, I didn't know that.

147
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.539
Awesome, thank you very much.
