>> Brian Holt: And while you were on a lunch, I figured out the styled components issue, so let's go back and do that real quick. So, when we did flow-type, again, this is kind of a nascent ecosystem here. So we're still kind of figuring out how to get this to all play nicely together.

[00:00:17]
When we did flow-typed install,
>> Brian Holt: it was able to go out and grab almost all the definitions, except one, which is the one definition that we were ignoring. So now the flow had no concept of this, and was also being ignored. So it just assumed that module did not exist.

[00:00:39]
And the reason why is, Styles components was updated maybe two days before we started this course, and so I updated it cuz I wanted to be using the latest and greatest tech. Unfortunately, they haven't had time to release new types for version 2, they only have a type for version 1.4.

[00:00:57]
However, the API that we are going to be using, we're not using many of the new features or any of the new features really. So we can go ahead and use the old type definitions and be mostly fine. So I want you to go in to your command line, I want you to type flow-typed install styled-components@1.4, I think that should work.

[00:01:28]

>> Brian Holt: Honestly, you can probably just do 1.
>> Brian Holt: No, do 1.4.
>> Brian Holt: And that'll give you the types for 1.46, I think. Is that what it says? No, it just doesn't say, okay, so 1.4. And that should be sufficient for what we're using, despite the fact that we're using two.

[00:01:50]
So, a little bit of a dangerous operation, right? But it's gonna work. So, just rest assure that I've been down this path.
>> Brian Holt: So, now if we say yarn flow, it should work. So we can get rid of this. I had right here // $FlowFixMe which it says like, ignore the next line, right?

[00:02:14]
But we can get rid of that now and everything should be working.
>> Brian Holt: You should be seeing no errors.
>> Brian Holt: Cool, any questions about that? Any questions about types or anything like that, in general? So I've only shown you a couple ways of doing typing. But we're gonna keep going and doing more and more types as we go.

[00:02:41]
So we'll be learning little bits and pieces about how to do specific type of adaptations and some of the advantages that you can get from the typing system that we now have in place. Again, none of this is required. There's no problem if you just decide to remove add flow from all of your documents and just keep going without types.

[00:03:01]
So I don't want for you to think that this is a required part of React because it's definitely not, nor is it necessary tied to React. You can write angular projects with Flow as well.
