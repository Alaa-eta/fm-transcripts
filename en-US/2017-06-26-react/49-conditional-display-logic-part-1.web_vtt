00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: so, now we need
to make this header account for

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.510
what happens with,
let's actually do that, too, as well.

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.910
So we're going to turn this
into a component here.

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.700
It's be really nice on details pages,

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.720
if there was a back button in the header
that you could go back to search results.

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.937
So let's go ahead and
make use of that too.

7
00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:32.482
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what we're going
to do here is we're going to say If.

8
00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:46.535
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like a show,
well, how do I want to do that?

9
00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:49.761
I'm going to create something called util

10
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:54.914
space,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

11
00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:56.530
we are going to take in a props here.

12
00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:05.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we are going to pass
in a property called showSearch, right?

13
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.660
So if a user wants to show,
or let me rephrase that,

14
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.320
if you are on the search page, you're
going to want to show a search box, right?

15
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.030
If you're on the details page you're
going to want to show a back button to go

16
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.930
back to the search result.

17
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.940
So if we pass in this
bouillon show search,

18
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.330
then we're going to say utispace is equal
to, we'll say for now, just like an h1.

19
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.090
We'll come back to it.

20
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.245
Else util space is going to be equal
to this h2 that we're going to create.

21
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
it's going to be another link,

22
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.256
which is going to go back to slash search,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: which is

23
00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:57.526
going to say back and
then close that and close that.

24
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.219
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're going to have this
util space right here and then that's just

25
00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.463
going to go underneath the,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: h1 here.

26
00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:18.847
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, now we have these
props.search, so the first thing were

27
00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.740
going to have to identify is
what these props can look like.

28
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.265
So, one of them can be showSearch,
it's just going to be a bool.

29
00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:31.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But the thing is this
is going to be optional, right?

30
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.372
It's going to be an opt in sort of things.

31
00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:36.820
So we're going to make it a maybe type,
like it might show up, it might not.

32
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.170
If it's there then, yes,
show them the search box, right?

33
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.560
If it's not there, then we're just
going to assume they want the back.

34
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.860
However, if you remember,

35
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.640
you have to give it default props
if something like that happens.

36
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.961
So I'm going to go down
here at the bottom and

37
00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:05.234
say header.defaultProps equals showSearch,

38
00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:10.730
which we're going to default to false.

39
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.016
If they don't ask for sure,

40
00:03:12.016 --> 00:03:14.703
then we're just going to assume
that they didn't want it.

41
00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:19.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so
that's how you do this.

42
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.570
Maybe type here.

43
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.820
So now, if we save this and
we come back and

44
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.090
refresh here, notice way over here
in the corner we have a back button.

45
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.942
And if we hit back, its going to take
us back to the search results page.

46
00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.373
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool?

47
00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:42.276
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Can you
go back to the header?

48
00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:44.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
then this is the maybe type right here,

49
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.960
and then down here you just have to
tell it what the default props are.
