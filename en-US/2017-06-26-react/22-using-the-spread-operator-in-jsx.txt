[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: So I wanna show you something, I have it here in my notes. But ultimately I think this is an anti pattern so we're gonna leave it the way it is. Well, up to you. So if we go back to search, notice how we're passing in show as one entire object, right?

[00:00:19]
Well, it would be kind of nice if we could do kind of passing all of the,
>> Brian Holt: All the different properties as top level items, right? So instead of saying props.show.title that we could just say props.title, right? So there's a couple ways you could do that. You could totally just say title equals show.title, right?

[00:00:47]
And pass in each one of them individually. Totally would work. There's another way to do this. And it's kind of an anti pattern, but I'm going to show you how to do it because I'm sure you're going to run into it. You can say ...show. This is called the object spread which is not yet a part of JavaScript or at least let me rephrase that.

[00:01:10]
This is specific to JSX, but it's emulating this object spread operator, which is stage three, I believe now for JavaScript. The array spread is a part of JavaScript, the object spread is forthcoming.
>> Brian Holt: And this is just saying, rather than me saying title equals show.title description equals show.description is just saying spread all that stuff out, and so it's all top level items.

[00:01:40]
So if we do this, in fact we'll just do it for now so you can just see how it's done. Now we going to go back here and everywhere it says show like that, we get to eliminate. So now it just says, and yep, that one, too. And rather than show being a shape, we're just gonna delete that and delete that, and now they're all top level items.

[00:02:11]

>> Brian Holt: Any questions about that?
>> Brian Holt: So a place where I would be okay using the spread operator is when I know what the shape of every single item is, right? I know everything that's in that item. The place where you run into problems is, let's say that inside of this data.json.

[00:02:36]
In fact, it's kind of already happening, right? So we have this imdbID right, that's being passed down into our show card now. I guess it kind of was before cuz it was a tag along in the show item. But that's being passed on to the show card, and the ShowCard does not need it, which is kind of a problem.

[00:02:55]

>> Brian Holt: It's a problem in the sense of you're moving around a bunch of data that you don't have to, and it's just messy. It's messy coding. It's not being very explicit.
>> Brian Holt: So in this particular case it might make sense to you just say, actually go out and list each one of them.

[00:03:16]

>> Brian Holt: I mean if there's one thing I've learned over the years of coding it's that usually being explicit is worth it. Even at the cost of writing more code.
>> Brian Holt: So up to you. We'll leave it for now.
>> Brian Holt: But that's what that looks like.
>> Speaker 2: But it's sounds like prop types is okay with extra attributes.

[00:03:38]

>> Brian Holt: Yeah. That's not gonna complain. So and we have a new thing here kinda showing up. Now if you did the at, go back to ShowCard and give it a shape so we can shut up the linter. Now we don't need shape anymore, we just need string.
