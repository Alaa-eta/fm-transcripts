>> Brian: So now, basically everything is completed on the Redux side, but now we need to go in and make the UI actually dispatch out to Redux, okay? So I want you to go to hap.jsx just real quick.
>> Brian: The first thing that we need to do is we need to basically make Redux available to React.

[00:00:25]
So we're gonna import { Provider } from 'react-redux'.
>> Brian: So react-redux is a package that all it does is it's just thin little bindings between React and Redux that make it easier to write Redux with React. It's by no means a hard requirement that you use react-redux, you definitely do not have to, but let me rephrase that you're gonna want to, for sure.

[00:01:00]
It just does a lot of the glue layer stuff that's really un-fun to do, and they do a good job at it. So inside of BrowserRouter, we're just gonna put Provider and then again right there Provider.
>> Brian: So yep, that's what I thought. Flow is gonna yell at you.

[00:01:26]
And this is another advantage to using Flow here. It's gonna say, hey, I'm expecting something called store, and you did not give it to me. So, I just forgot momentarily that you also have to provide it a store. So, let's go ahead and do that real quick. So, we're just gonna go import store from './store'.

[00:01:51]

>> Brian: And then here you're just gonna say store={store}.
>> Brian: So this is another reason that I like Flow. I love that my tools remind me to do stuff like this cuz I totally would have forgot and moved on right now.
>> Brian: But that all happens because we have React Redux typings from flow typed.

[00:02:20]

>> Brian: Something that people will point out to me is that, you could totally, it makes no difference if provider's on the outside or browser writer's on the outside. It will work either way. I intentionally chose it this way because we're gonna do server-side rendering tomorrow. And that makes it a lot easier if it's organized this way, but if you weren't doing server-side rendering it wouldn't make a difference.

[00:02:42]
Again, this is what's called a higher order component. It itself displays nothing but it just does some stuff for you that it puts, its gonna put Redux on context, which is what we were talking about previously. So that we can refer to it in other places inside of our app, so that is whats happening there.
