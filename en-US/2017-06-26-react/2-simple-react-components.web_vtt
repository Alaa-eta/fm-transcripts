WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
we kinda have our bare bones set up here.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.510
So, let's actually start writing
some react cuz so far what we have,

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.440
this is not a very good intro to react.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.950
So here, instead of my complete intro to
react, I'm going to create a new file.

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.045
And it's going to be called Index.html.

6
00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:34.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, I'm gonna put
the bare bones for an HTML document.

7
00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:39.212
.HTML:5.

8
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.390
So I'm using something called emit,

9
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.820
which is kind of outside the scope of
this class, but it's super useful.

10
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.370
Used to be called zen coding.

11
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.440
It's just like a bunch of shortcuts for
writing HTML really fast.

12
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.154
Which is how I scaffolded that out.

13
00:00:56.154 --> 00:01:00.150
We're gonna create a file and

14
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.220
I'm gonna call it svideo you can call,
that's what I named my little app here.

15
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.890
You can call your video app
whatever you wanna call it.

16
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.260
Here we're going to put a div, and
its ID is gonna be called app.

17
00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:23.952
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're
going to do two things right here.

18
00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:28.693
We're gonna put two script tags,

19
00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:33.108
one of them is going to be equal to

20
00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:39.500
node_modules/react/dist/react.js.

21
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.016
So we're gonna be pulling in
the pre-bundled react file,

22
00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:48.910
so that we can play with it,
without doing any sort of bundling.

23
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.740
And then the other thing we're gonna do,
is we're gonna do another script tag.

24
00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.032
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 'node_modules'

25
00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:09.992
/react-dom/dist/react-dom.js.

26
00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:12.330
So here's a big key about react here.

27
00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:19.251
I imagine a lot of you have heard
of things like React Native and

28
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:22.510
React VR deframe react omission.

29
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.580
There's a bunch of them, right?

30
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.790
So, you can think of reacting
kind of split into two parts.

31
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.970
Meaning, if you're gonna use react,

32
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.110
you're always gonna have to
require two different libraries.

33
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.920
There is a top level react part, which is
the same across react native, react dom,

34
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.910
react everything.

35
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.900
This is the library where we
actually create components.

36
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.154
And has the life cycle methods,

37
00:02:43.154 --> 00:02:46.610
it has all these different things that
you as a developer interact with.

38
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.660
And then, between react and
whatever you're rendering to,

39
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.240
there sits a glue layer, right?

40
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.750
That translates react components to
DOM nodes or to Native UI elements.

41
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.170
So that's what React Native is,
that's what ReactDOM is,

42
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.350
it's these different glue layers,
the rendering layers.

43
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.030
So we're gonna actually
be coding with react,

44
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.560
but at the very end we'll pull in ReactDOM
to actually render out to the DOM.

45
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.559
So that's why there are two
separate libraries.

46
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.351
It used to be the same thing up until,
like react.12, maybe.

47
00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:27.180
No, don't quote me on that.

48
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.170
So, underneath that we're
gonna do a script tag.

49
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800
So when we pull these in,
React and ReactDom,

50
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.450
it's gonna make them available as
a global Variable that we can refer to.

51
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.870
So now we have react and react-dom.

52
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.965
So the first thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna say const,

53
00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:57.630
MyFirstComponent, and
it's gonna just be a function.

54
00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:08.833
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna say return

55
00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:18.306
React.createElement('div', null,).

56
00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:20.640
And I'm gonna do some kind
of funky spacing here, but

57
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.780
it'll make sense in
a moment why I did that.

58
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.940
Then here I'm going to say
React.creatEelement('h1',

59
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.503
null, 'This is my first component!') or
whatever you wanna render out.

60
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:41.932
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

61
00:04:46.127 --> 00:04:52.752
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then here at the bottom,
I'm gonna say, ReactDOM.render.

62
00:04:58.052 --> 00:05:06.004
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna say
React.createElements(MyFirstComponent).

63
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:07.618
And then we're gonna tell where to render.

64
00:05:07.618 --> 00:05:13.568
So, in this case we want to render up here

65
00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:18.818
in the app id, so we're gonna say,

66
00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:25.308
document.getElementById('app').

67
00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:30.643
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'll explain
it momentarily, but let's go and

68
00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:33.410
make sure that I'm not full of shit and
it actually works.

69
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.110
There's always a distinct possibility
that I'm making things up.

70
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.480
So I'm gonna literally just
open the file with my browser.

71
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.890
Eventually, we'll get to
serving with a server,

72
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.340
whatever, but this will work for now.

73
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.034
Let's see, so I need to go to talks,

74
00:05:55.034 --> 00:06:00.100
no, there we go, index.html.

75
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.470
And you can see here it says This
is my first component, right?

76
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.310
This is React at it's most base level.

77
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.450
And that's all you're gonna learn in this
workshop, so wrap it up, we're done.

78
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.540
Just kidding.

79
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.360
Well, I mean, sort of.

80
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.220
No, I am kidding [LAUGH].

81
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.830
Okay, so
let's talk about what's going on here.

82
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.200
So here we're creating a react component.

83
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.300
This is called MyFirstComponent.

84
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.950
What you can think of like a blueprint for
creating new components.

85
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.920
Or for those of you who like the Java E,
Class E, project orientedness,

86
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.500
this is a class.

87
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.888
And we can create many
instances of this class.

88
00:06:43.888 --> 00:06:46.940
So, we have created a reusable
component here that every time that we

89
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.200
render it out, so

90
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.309
if I inspect this element right here
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You

91
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:58.300
can see here there is a div and a h1.

92
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.540
So every time that I create
a new like stamp, a new instance

93
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.550
of this MyFirstComponent is going to
render out this particular bit of markup.

94
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.934
Now, this isn't really super
interesting right now,

95
00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:16.021
like it's really just a div and an H1.

96
00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:19.099
It would have been way easier to
just me going in here and say, okay,

97
00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:21.420
I'm gonna put a div right here.

98
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.780
But where's the fun in that?

99
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.680
I wanted to over engineer it.

100
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.040
Now hopefully this is indicative to
you that at it's most base layer,

101
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.920
there's not really a lot to react.

102
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.080
The hello world to react is what,
this is gonna be ten lines of code.

103
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:45.070
So, let's go in and
talk about React.createElement then.

104
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.640
So this function right here is a class.

105
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.970
It's the my first component class.

106
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.230
Create element is creating
a particular element of something.

107
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.950
So I'm creating one div instance.

108
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.300
I'm not creating a new type of div.

109
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.270
This is just rendering out a div.

110
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.710
Same thing here with this H1.

111
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.840
Then here I call createElement,

112
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.950
same thing right here, I'm creating
an instance of my first component.

113
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.137
So I could create another
component which renders out yet

114
00:08:17.137 --> 00:08:18.694
more of my first component.

115
00:08:18.694 --> 00:08:22.050
So they can be, components can be
composed of other components as well.

116
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.410
Any questions about this example so far?

117
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.420
Not super useful yet, but
we're getting to the useful part, promise.

118
00:08:35.908 --> 00:08:38.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's actually go
create another type of component.

119
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.946
So, I'm gonna create another
one called My Title.

120
00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:48.480
So const Mytitle,
it's gonna be another function.

121
00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:58.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And what this is gonna
do is it's going return more markup.

122
00:09:02.707 --> 00:09:11.844
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna say
React.createElement('div', null).

123
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:21.425
And were gonna say
React.createElement('h1', h2).

124
00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:23.815
So something that you
might be noting here,

125
00:09:23.815 --> 00:09:28.490
if I pass the string it's actually
going to render out, that sort of tag.

126
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.560
It's not even really gonna
keep track of what it is.

127
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:37.820
I could put 'x-my-component' and
it would render out an x-my-component tag.

128
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.550
So this also works with web components
if you want to go down that path.

129
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:47.180
If I pass it like a variable
name like this MyFirstComponent,

130
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.090
it's not a string,
it's a MyFirstComponent.

131
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.600
It's actually going to render out that
it's going to assume that it's a react

132
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.670
component and
try to render it out that way.

133
00:10:03.264 --> 00:10:05.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this is gonna be my second component.

134
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.854
And then we're gonna
modify this down here.

135
00:10:10.854 --> 00:10:17.905
What's cool about this is, createElement,

136
00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:23.710
so I'm gonna put MyTitle in here.

137
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.830
But I can actually put
multiple Myitles in here.

138
00:10:30.164 --> 00:10:33.833
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So for those of you
that like the computer science terms,

139
00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:37.180
createElement has variable errity, right?

140
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.470
So you can give it as many
perimeters as you want,

141
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.555
that's all that that stupid term means.

142
00:10:41.555 --> 00:10:46.321
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah so

143
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:48.680
we're going to be creating
multiple instances of MyTitle.

144
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.350
The other thing that you can do with
this is you can give it an array.

145
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.020
You can give it an array of react
instead of the elements, right?

146
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.130
Right now this isn't super important.

147
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.795
They kind of look the same, but this will
become important later in the course.

148
00:11:04.795 --> 00:11:08.940
So, just keep in mind that you can
also pass it, arrays of components.

149
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.370
So let's go try and
make sure that that works.

150
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.450
You can see here I got a bunch of
instances of my second component.
