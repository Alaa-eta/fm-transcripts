1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.040
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now what I wanna show you is
some of the debugging tools, right?

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.410
So far we've been doing
things like console.log, and

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.640
kind of that sort of stuff,
to do debugging.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.300
There's actually React's Dev Tools,
which are super helpful.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.980
So I'm gonna go and open my console here.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.630
And, yeah,
do I need to install it for this?

7
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.620
So they're available for Firefox,
and they're available for Chrome.

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.802
They're not available for Safari or Edge.

9
00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:35.756
If you really wanted to get creative
you can probably make it work,

10
00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:39.393
cuz Chrome Dev Tools can
target other browsers.

11
00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:40.690
I'll leave that to your discretion.

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.080
But we're gonna go pull
up the React Dev Tools.

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.528
And you can see here, the React Dev Tools,
here in the Chrome Web Store.

14
00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.535
&gt;&gt; Brian: I'm going to ahead and
add that to Chrome.

15
00:01:00.106 --> 00:01:06.920
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and now I'm gonna go back
to my app here and refresh the page.

16
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.193
I might have to restart my application.

17
00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:21.756
&gt;&gt; Brian: Inspect.

18
00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:34.300
&gt;&gt; Brian: Am I just missing it?

19
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.945
It's the one right after Redux there.

20
00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:37.950
Last one, there it is.

21
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.220
Okay, sorry.

22
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.720
I'm blind.

23
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.260
So now we have a tab here in our browser.

24
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.810
It should appear relatively similar in
Firefox, it will just be a tab on there.

25
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.550
We're going to open it.

26
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.380
And now if you check this out, you can
actually see the component hierarchy

27
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.930
that our React components look like.

28
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.180
The one thing you might notice here,

29
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.940
is that there's some stuff that
you may not expect to be there.

30
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.370
For example, we have App, right?

31
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.255
That's the top level one,
we know what that one is.

32
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:09.492
BrowserRouter, we also put that one there.

33
00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:13.169
But BrowserRouter itself is rendering
its own router components, so

34
00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.110
we see that here.

35
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.445
That's rendering out a div, which is
rendering out the switch, which we did.

36
00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:22.670
And then we have this lowercase component,
right?

37
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.830
What is that?

38
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.460
Well remember,

39
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.120
in order to render search, we had that
anonymous component that renders search.

40
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.670
So let me show you what that looks like.

41
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.130
Notice how this is a function here, right?

42
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.440
That's the anonymous component.

43
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.560
That's this component, right there, right?

44
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.352
Okay, so that's the function that
renders search, which is this.

45
00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:50.861
And then you can go down, you can see
all the various show cards, right?

46
00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:52.490
And you can actually dive into them.

47
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.980
And you can see here,
you can see all the props.

48
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.160
You can see the key that it used.

49
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.600
If I go up here to search,
and I click on that,

50
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.340
I can actually see the state
that's interior to that.

51
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.575
What's kinda fun is, if it's state,

52
00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:12.820
I can actually just change it
directly here in the dev tools.

53
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.180
It's not super interesting,
cuz I can just do it up here as well.

54
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.860
But sometimes you have state that's
a little bit more difficult to get at, so

55
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.920
that's kind of useful.

56
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.390
You can't rewrite props, right?

57
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.654
That makes sense, because this
component wouldn't have access to that.

58
00:03:30.424 --> 00:03:32.325
&gt;&gt; Brian: You can do things
like Highlight Updates.

59
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.230
So if you're kind of confused
about how things are changing.

60
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.111
Notice that my dev tools are flashing
yellow when I delete and update things?

61
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.114
&gt;&gt; Brian: So that's pretty cool.

62
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:54.580
&gt;&gt; Brian: You can also even
see that it's updating.

63
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.430
You can see it flashing
a little bit as I'm typing.

64
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.907
So that's a neat little tool there.

65
00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:07.020
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah,
it works just like the browser.

66
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.810
That if I highlight one of these, it's
going to highlight it on the DOM as well.

67
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.840
And that's something that's
even nice as well, right?

68
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.430
So, [COUGH] let's say I'm really
interested in this Stranger Things

69
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.620
title right here.

70
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.305
If I right-click on that and
say Inspect Element,

71
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:25.210
it's still gonna bring me here, right?

72
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.681
But if I click React
immediately after that,

73
00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:31.793
it's gonna also deep link me into there,
in the React Dev Tools, as well.

74
00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:35.591
So you can also do the right-click &gt;
Inspect Element workflow to get what

75
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:36.761
you're looking for.

76
00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.620
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

77
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.260
Something else that I wanted to show you.

78
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.360
So let's say I'm really interested in
this House of Cards component right here,

79
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.180
but I wanna be able to
interact with it directly.

80
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.840
I can click on it, so now it's
highlighted in my React Dev Tools.

81
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.931
I can go into the console and
I can say $r,

82
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:03.810
and that's going to refer to the component
that I have highlighted, right?

83
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.563
So this is a stateless component,
and I can open it, and

84
00:05:08.563 --> 00:05:11.307
say props and things like that.

85
00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:14.753
&gt;&gt; Brian: So let's deal with search,

86
00:05:14.753 --> 00:05:17.490
because that's a little bit
more interesting as well.

87
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.860
So if i go back to React,
and I click here on search.

88
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.870
So now I have $r again,
it's gonna be set to search.

89
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.583
So I can say, $r.setState,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

90
00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:38.513
I wanna set it so searchTerm is,
let's say, valley.

91
00:05:43.898 --> 00:05:47.010
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then it's gonna call
setState for me on that component.

92
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.772
And in this particular case, that means
that it's gonna search for Silicon Valley.

93
00:05:51.772 --> 00:05:54.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How did
you assign search to r?

94
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.890
Sorry about that.

95
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.817
&gt;&gt; Brian: So if you go under React Dev
Tools, and if I click on ShowCard here,

96
00:05:58.817 --> 00:05:59.320
right?

97
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.611
Or I click on Search.

98
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:05.966
Whatever I have highlighted in my
React Dev Tools is going to be

99
00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:08.824
available on console as $r.

100
00:06:08.824 --> 00:06:09.946
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I see.

101
00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:14.742
&gt;&gt; Brian: Just as a side, if you go
into the Elements and I click on this,

102
00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:17.616
that's gonna be available as $0.

103
00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:19.580
That's always worked for Chrome Dev Tools.

104
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.803
So there's kinda mimicking them,
that behavior.

105
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.700
&gt;&gt; Brian: So this is just a really,
really useful way of debugging React.

106
00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:37.313
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's say I have
a huge application, and

107
00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.040
I need to find all the ShowCards.

108
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.830
You can actually use the search up
here to search for various components.

109
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.932
That's also useful to have.

110
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.490
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's new.

111
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.770
I had never seen that before.

112
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.400
So you can click this little
target right there, and

113
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.390
then you can kind of find
the thing that you're looking for.

114
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.730
So I'm looking for this, right?

115
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.580
And it's gonna take me to that.

116
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.145
That's pretty cool.

117
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.041
&gt;&gt; Brian: So,
definitely don't leave home without it.

118
00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:08.644
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
