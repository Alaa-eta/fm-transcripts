>> Speaker 1: Well what do you do to manage data base content updates that might break the code or may break the test?
>> Brian Holt: Well, your test should never be reading directly from the database that's the big code smell right there that if you're testing that integration that's too much, that's too much depth to your test.

[00:00:18]
So, with Redux, what you're gonna do is you're going to grab what a database response looks like. And then you're going to pass that in as the action, right, and then you'll test that. And then you're probably gonna wanna have some sort of integration test that tests your whole app top to bottom, right, maybe that's Selenium.

[00:00:37]
Maybe that's, I don't know, something else, and you should also have server side tests that would catch regressions, in terms of like the shape of your API responses on the server side. So, yeah, there should be several layers of testing that should catch that, so that's not necessarily test here.

[00:00:56]
I think it's the answer to that or at least, that's what I would do.
