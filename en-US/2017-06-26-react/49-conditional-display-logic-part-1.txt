>> Brian Holt: so, now we need to make this header account for what happens with, let's actually do that, too, as well. So we're going to turn this into a component here. It's be really nice on details pages, if there was a back button in the header that you could go back to search results.

[00:00:19]
So let's go ahead and make use of that too.
>> Brian Holt: So what we're going to do here is we're going to say If.
>> Brian Holt: Like a show, well, how do I want to do that? I'm going to create something called util space,
>> Brian Holt: And we are going to take in a props here.

[00:00:59]

>> Brian Holt: And we are going to pass in a property called showSearch, right? So if a user wants to show, or let me rephrase that, if you are on the search page, you're going to want to show a search box, right? If you're on the details page you're going to want to show a back button to go back to the search result.

[00:01:19]
So if we pass in this bouillon show search, then we're going to say utispace is equal to, we'll say for now, just like an h1. We'll come back to it. Else util space is going to be equal to this h2 that we're going to create.
>> Brian Holt: And it's going to be another link, which is going to go back to slash search,

[00:01:53]

>> Brian Holt: which is going to say back and then close that and close that.
>> Brian Holt: So we're going to have this util space right here and then that's just going to go underneath the,
>> Brian Holt: h1 here.
>> Brian Holt: So, now we have these props.search, so the first thing were going to have to identify is what these props can look like.

[00:02:21]
So, one of them can be showSearch, it's just going to be a bool.
>> Brian Holt: But the thing is this is going to be optional, right? It's going to be an opt in sort of things. So we're going to make it a maybe type, like it might show up, it might not.

[00:02:36]
If it's there then, yes, show them the search box, right? If it's not there, then we're just going to assume they want the back. However, if you remember, you have to give it default props if something like that happens. So I'm going to go down here at the bottom and say header.defaultProps equals showSearch, which we're going to default to false.

[00:03:10]
If they don't ask for sure, then we're just going to assume that they didn't want it.
>> Brian Holt: And so that's how you do this. Maybe type here. So now, if we save this and we come back and refresh here, notice way over here in the corner we have a back button.

[00:03:30]
And if we hit back, its going to take us back to the search results page.
>> Brian Holt: Cool?
>> Audience 1: Can you go back to the header?
>> Brian Holt: So then this is the maybe type right here, and then down here you just have to tell it what the default props are.
