WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So far we've just
been running this from file, right?

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.245
If you look at my path up here.

3
00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.322
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's get
rid of all of that stuff.

4
00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:18.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I was running it that way.

5
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.179
So, in any case.

6
00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.688
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see so
command open and

7
00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:35.377
I was just running this from,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: File, right?

8
00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:39.510
[COUGH] When you're
using the file protocol

9
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.290
I'm gonna talk from
a Unix based perspective.

10
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.770
I don't know how it works in Windows, but
I imagine there are similar problems.

11
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.610
There's just a lot of limitations, right?

12
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.800
So you don't wanna be doing this very
long for any sort of decent dev process.

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.260
It's useful for writing CSS and
stuff like that, but much more than that,

14
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.780
it falls apart pretty quickly.

15
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.910
In other words,
we need a static file server, right?

16
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.680
Now we can bring in
something like HTTP server.

17
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.175
We could bring in like SimplePython,
SimpleHTPServer from Python or

18
00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:14.000
PHP-S, there's a bunch of ways to do it.

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.270
However, there's a particular
tool called webpack dev server

20
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.000
that makes this a lot easier and
it's gonna buy us a lot more too.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.820
So we're gonna go ahead and
introduce that real quick.

22
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.975
So I want you to go to
your web pack config and

23
00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:27.820
there's really only one thing
that we're gonna need to do.

24
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.765
We're gonna add one more object you can
put it really anywhere just call it

25
00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:37.606
dev-server
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

26
00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:41.070
we're gonna put in here a public path.

27
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.755
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is letting Webpack
know where you anticipate your bundle

28
00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:59.712
being served from, so that whenever
you go to serve files from that,

29
00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:04.940
it knows where to go grab those files and
where they're being output to.

30
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.069
Now, for us, we have a public directory,
and we're serving from public, right?

31
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.180
That's just coincidence that
they're the same thing, right?

32
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.880
I can be serving from
the public directory, but

33
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.060
it could be called static
assets on my server, right?

34
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.483
So, this is the name of the path on
the server, if that makes any sense, okay?

35
00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:37.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, now what I can do here,
is I can come to my command line.

36
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.475
And I'm gonna, if you're running Watch,
stop your Watch.

37
00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:44.637
And then do ./node_modules

38
00:02:44.637 --> 00:02:49.282
.bin/webpack-dev-server.

39
00:02:55.452 --> 00:02:59.366
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now it's gonna run
a server for me at localhost 8080,

40
00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:02.560
it's gonna sere all your
output from /public.

41
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.350
But it's also gonna be doing the watch for
you as well.

42
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.190
So every time you save

43
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.599
something it's going to be
constantly recompiling your code.

44
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.300
So, it's like watch and
your static file rolled up into one thing.

45
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.412
So, now if I go to local host ADAD,

46
00:03:17.412 --> 00:03:21.160
now [LAUGH] things are actually
serving up the way they should, right?

47
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.530
That's where the image came from.

48
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.580
So what I want you to do real quick
it's important that we're gonna take

49
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.210
a second and kind of emphasize, cuz people
always miss this when I do this workshop.

50
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.434
Go to your index.html.

51
00:03:37.142 --> 00:03:39.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna wait,
make sure everyone's there.

52
00:03:41.786 --> 00:03:44.294
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then in front of public, in both places,

53
00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:46.940
both in the script and the link.

54
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.620
Please put a leading slash.

55
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.912
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It works now
because we're on the homepage but

56
00:03:54.912 --> 00:04:00.490
as we start having different paths, that
relative path is going to be incorrect.

57
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.520
So we always want it
to serve from /public.

58
00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:08.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did
everyone put two slashes?

59
00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:13.610
[LAUGH] Okay, cool I believe you.

60
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.308
And if you ask me the question,
I'm gonna throw something at you I swear.

61
00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:19.590
[LAUGH] Just kidding.

62
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.076
I mean maybe, but don't test me.

63
00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:24.650
[COUGH] Cool.

64
00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:29.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is awesome, right?

65
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.190
The dev server, that's one of
the really nice parts about Webpack,

66
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.540
is that it ships with this dev server.

67
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.210
And we're only scratching the surface.

68
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.820
In fact,
I wanted to show you something else, too.

69
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.380
So let's go back and
reintroduce some sort of linting error.

70
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.270
So constx=5 right, lintair,
open your consul here,

71
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.596
and you're gonna see right
away some sort of error.

72
00:04:57.034 --> 00:05:02.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But now if I get rid of it,
save it, it's gone.

73
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.720
So again, another part of Webpack
Dev Server, is every time the bundle

74
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.240
refreshes, it's just gonna hard
refresh your browser for you.

75
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.320
Which is also pretty nice, right.

76
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.120
Cuz you can just save it and
then go over to your browser and

77
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.920
it's gonna be reloaded.

78
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.360
Now inevitably someone wants
to ask me about module reload.

79
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.669
We're gonna do it in a little bit,
not yet, hold your horses,

80
00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.185
we're not there yet.

81
00:05:31.402 --> 00:05:37.116
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so, go ahead
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone asked about setting

82
00:05:37.116 --> 00:05:43.287
up all this tooling by yourself versus
using something like Create React app?

83
00:05:43.287 --> 00:05:48.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yes Create React app is
a really, really cool piece of technology.

84
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.830
So again a lot of people's common
complaint is that the tooling is so

85
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.420
complicated and difficult to set up and
difficult to understand.

86
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.040
Like, I'm giving a three day workshop just
so you can understand the tooling, right?

87
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.630
That's about half the workshop.

88
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.860
So something like Create React app totally
obscures all this from you, right.

89
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.740
It just works,right.

90
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.580
It just works straight out of the box.

91
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.520
The trade off there is that you have
no control over your tools, right.

92
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.350
So Create React app is really a great
way to scaffold up a project,

93
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.760
get rolling with it.

94
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.920
And then what Create React app does for
you,

95
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.780
is it allows you to eject all of the,
the term is eject,

96
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.040
it removes itself from the project and
it gives you all of the configs, right.

97
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.190
So you're not locked in to using
Create React app all the time, so

98
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.660
it ejects the webpack config,
the babel config, the eslyn config So

99
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.630
it's kind of an all or
nothing thing, right?

100
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.450
You either use Create React App or
you don't.

101
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.245
[LAUGH] So the trade off here is if
you're willing to give up that control,

102
00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:53.665
it's amazing and totally worth it because
the product they set up for you is really,

103
00:06:53.665 --> 00:06:54.490
really great.

104
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.790
You can build large scale application
on Create React App, no problem.

105
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.340
They give you a great depth config,
they give you a great production config.

106
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.200
However, if you even need to change one
thing, you have to eject it, right?

107
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.720
So we're not using it today because
I want you to touch the tools.

108
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.200
I want you to feel the tools I want
you to feel why you have them.

109
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.140
I want you to understand what each one
of them does and how to set them up.

110
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.810
So when you go to your
individual companies and

111
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.240
projects and clients, that you know
yourself how to manipulate the tools and

112
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.920
get the best performance and address
all the needs for what you're doing.

113
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.240
So if you're interested in Create React
app, I have another repo on my GitHub,

114
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.360
that's a similar type project
that we're doing right now.

115
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.440
But it uses Create React app and
it's much more focused on react and

116
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.470
redux rather than on the tooling.

117
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.150
A lot of this workshop
focus is on the tooling.

118
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.070
You're welcome to go in and
compare and contrast.

119
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.078
That will be Open Source forever,
so you're welcome to check it out.

120
00:07:57.078 --> 00:08:03.202
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I appreciate this cuz
in the past it's been like npn start and

121
00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:06.460
it works and I don't even know how.

122
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,
it's total black magic.

123
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.260
It's a total black box, right?

124
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:09.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

125
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:17.676
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What is the repo for
the example that you've got on here?

126
00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:22.643
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's nho.lt/redux
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think I

127
00:08:22.643 --> 00:08:24.993
have some updating to do for
it, but it should be 99% good.

128
00:08:30.514 --> 00:08:33.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You build a pet
adoption app, which is pretty fun.
