00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.590
&gt;&gt; Brian: We're done with React,
and people are like what?

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.800
What happened?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.390
React is not really that big of a library,

4
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.060
there's only 30 methods
total that React exposes.

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.160
We're pretty much done
with our app in general.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.200
We haven't made this thing work yet.

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.610
But that wouldn't be very hard to do.

8
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.540
We would just move all this
state into app, right?

9
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.260
And then, we'll distribute
search term through landing and

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.710
search term through search, right?

11
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.720
We've already shown you how to refactor
that so that we can make that work, right?

12
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.840
So I'm gonna show you how to do that.

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.499
You're welcome to do on your own.
&gt;&gt; Brian: But

14
00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:41.932
right now you are armed with
enough knowledge to go build large

15
00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:45.780
applications in React,
and that's amazing right?

16
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.590
For this size of app there is absolutely
no reason to introduce something

17
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.440
like Redux.

18
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.940
It's just wild over-engineering, like
irresponsible, over engineering, right.

19
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.600
However, it's fun to irresponsibly
over-engineer things, right.

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
But, just keep in mind that,
you can build large-scale applications,

21
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.880
using purely just the techniques,
that I just showed you how to do.

22
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.070
So, that's why I was pretty
cautious to show you,

23
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.450
pretty much,
building an entire application in React.

24
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.830
And now we're gonna go back and
refactor in to include Redux, right.

25
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.390
But we're done, that's really it,

26
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.700
that's all you need to really
know about React in general.

27
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.250
So if you don't care about Redux,
just turn off your live stream.

28
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.220
No, I'm just kidding.

29
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.120
Don't tune out,
there's still really cool stuff to come.

30
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.590
In fact, I'm gonna show you
some debugging techniques and

31
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.120
I'm gonna show you perf tools right now.

32
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.910
So I'm going to show you some advanced
kind of stuff that you can do about React.

33
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.388
Any questions about React in general,

34
00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:48.891
before we move on to more
of how to debug it and

35
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:54.696
how to profile it?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like

36
00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:58.450
really it's just a process of
passing down props, setting state.

37
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.660
That's really, and like the lifecycle
method, that's the power of React.

38
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.310
And again one of my favorite parts
about it, it's a notable library.

39
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.230
You can know pretty much
everything about React.

40
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.710
Does anyone here want to assert that
they know everything about jQuery?

41
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.220
Does anyone even want to say that they've
used every method, well maybe Mark, but

42
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.745
I would believe that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Absolutely,

43
00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:22.416
I have used every single
method including internal

44
00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:23.125
methods.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.

45
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:24.530
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

46
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.091
&gt;&gt; Brian: So there's maybe two people,

47
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:28.613
there's Mark and John Resic,
and that's it that

48
00:02:28.613 --> 00:02:31.350
have used every method in jQuery.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well a couple of the core

49
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.868
team members.
&gt;&gt; Brian: I'm kidding,

50
00:02:32.868 --> 00:02:35.414
I'm sure there are literally
dozens of you.

51
00:02:35.414 --> 00:02:40.470
[LAUGH] Right, I have not, right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I know.

52
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.580
&gt;&gt; Brian: I have not.

53
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.930
There's over 200 approaching 300
methods in jQuery I think, right?

54
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.900
React, again has like 30.

55
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.230
Angular One had over a hundred for
sure, right?

56
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.360
So there's very very few people have all
of that in their brain all at once, right?

57
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.150
Whereas with React, you can really
understand all of the corners of React

58
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.690
pretty easily.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think the big difference

59
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.900
with React is the fact that you don't need
to know anything about the dom at all.

60
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.714
Right, and that is the big hairy part
of that JavaScript in general is,

61
00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:20.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Dom updating, and

62
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.680
dom methods.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, it's like-

63
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Reversing,

64
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.700
and-
&gt;&gt; Brian: The imperative

65
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.460
part of that, right?

66
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.980
Like building trees, and things like that.

67
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.670
All that stuff is kinda done for
behind the scenes.

68
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.150
All you need to do is you
need to write functions

69
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.490
that generate the markup that you want and
that's really it, right.

70
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.470
I mean there's some complications
with life cycle methods and

71
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.410
things like that but you're basically just
building functions that generate markup

72
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.390
and that's about it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Have you ever had to use

73
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.780
component should update for performance?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yes and

74
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.920
I'm gonna show you how right now.

75
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.020
In fact we have one component in here
that's really inefficiently updating.

76
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.030
And we're going to use the React Perf
tools to profile that.

77
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.370
But we're getting there.

78
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.820
We have one more thing first, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm just gonna ask what, so

79
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.190
the basic stuff we've done so

80
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.870
far, what percent of your time when you're
writing React does that usually cover.

81
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.430
Is it usually like 90% that?
&gt;&gt; Brian: I'm gonna go with 90.

82
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.440
Yeah, I think 90 sounds about good to me.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cool.

83
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.140
&gt;&gt; Brian: Nope I'm gonna go further I'm

84
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.090
gonna say it's like 95.

85
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.090
That last 5% is important.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
