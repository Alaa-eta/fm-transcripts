&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we're gonna be talking
about Hot Module Replacement, and which is

2
00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:08.044
a technology that is really awesome with
React due to the nature of how React.

3
00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.444
Apps are constructed, it lends itself
to this technology really well.

4
00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:16.391
Whereas, previously other technologies
like Angular and Amber, it was just

5
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:20.056
impossible to detangle them enough to
be able to do something like this.

6
00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:23.918
I was still kind of a evolving and
thrashing technology, but

7
00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:26.810
I feel finally comfortable
now teaching it.

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.150
Whereas previously for version one and
version two, it was still kind of new

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.695
enough that it wasn't worthy of teaching.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

10
00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:38.250
let's talk about what it actually is.

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.040
I imagine many of you have done
live reload before with CSS.

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.490
The idea being is that, as soon as
you change your CSS, it'll compile

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.300
your new CSS, and then it will inject
it into your running browser, right.

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.630
This is a really cool technology,

15
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.760
because you can be working on a menu
that you have to click once, twice,

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.170
three times, to get into like some
particular state of your app.

17
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.510
And, when you do live reload
it will inject the CSS,

18
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.820
you don't have to refresh the page.

19
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.030
It will just rewrite all the styles for
you, right.

20
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.050
This is really nice,
because you don't have to click, click,

21
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.470
click to get to the back
of that same state.

22
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.120
It really cuts down on that feedback loop
of being able to reiterate quickly on

23
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.464
whatever user interfaces you're writing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hot Module Replacement

24
00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.830
takes this one step further.

25
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.950
Webpack is actually smart enough to
see the graph of everything that what

26
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.470
depends on what, right.

27
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.370
So an example of that would be,
if I come into Search.jsx, right,

28
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.950
it also depends on ShowCard, right?

29
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.800
But if I go into Landing, Landing has
no coordination with ShowCard at all.

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.020
So if I modify for example ShowCard,,

31
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.140
search is going to have to be replaced,
right, because it also depends on that.

32
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.450
But Landing can stay right where it is,
right.

33
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.880
So it's trying this big dependency graph.

34
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.885
In fact,
I think I actually have the little

35
00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:03.020
graph here in my notes maybe,
right there, right.

36
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.090
So this is what I'm talking about.

37
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.960
So if I replace ShowCard,
I can actually just change ShowCard and

38
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.370
leave everything else as is.

39
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.200
Well, search is gonna
have to replace as well.

40
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.460
But landing can stay where it is.

41
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.700
So, armed with this knowledge, webpack can
say, cool, I'm gonna cut off this part of

42
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.820
the graph, replace it, and leave the other
parts of the graph in place, right.

43
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.030
So it's able to do this on the fly
without refreshing your browser at all.

44
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.128
Hence, Hot Module Replacement.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's really cool,

45
00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:34.352
I'm excited to teach it to you.

46
00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:37.600
It's not so difficult to set up.

47
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.690
I'm not gonna say it's easy, but it's
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not horrible.

48
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.600
Let's go with not horrible,
that's what I'm going with right now.

49
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.100
Okay,
