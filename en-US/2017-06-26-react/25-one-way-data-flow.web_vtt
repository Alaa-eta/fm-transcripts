00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.120
&gt;&gt; Brian: So let's talk about state.

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.410
So what we've talked about before
has been about props, right?

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.960
A child passing down data from
the parents to the child.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.248
And something interesting and useful
to talk about that is the parent can

5
00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:20.769
pass down data to the child, but
vice versa does not work, right?

6
00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.207
So the child has no concept of who
its parents are, which is sad,

7
00:00:26.207 --> 00:00:30.456
I suppose.
&gt;&gt; Brian: [COUGH] But

8
00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:34.780
it can interact with its parent,
it can't do anything.

9
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.080
The only thing it can do is
accept data from its parents, and

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.170
then do something with that data.

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.140
This is called one-way data flow.

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.516
I'm not gonna say React pioneered it, but

13
00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:48.620
it definitely made that popular
in the frontend landscape.

14
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.824
And now definitely Angular and Ember
have adopted that into their frameworks,

15
00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:55.217
and it's been good for
everyone all around.

16
00:00:55.217 --> 00:00:57.692
The reason why this is a really,
really, really good thing,

17
00:00:57.692 --> 00:01:00.590
it kinda feels like its tying
one hand behind your back.

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.060
Sorta is, but
it ends up being a huge net positive.

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.270
So if I have this component,
this component, and this component, and

20
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.450
I have a problem with the middle
component, right, and I can see that.

21
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.630
I can already eliminate the parent
component as being the problem, right?

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.910
Because the parent component has no
interaction with this child component.

23
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.284
Like they just kinda pass data back and
forth, right?

24
00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:28.561
And I guess vice versa is that
if the parent has problem,

25
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:32.889
you can eliminate all the children
components we're having any issues,

26
00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:36.610
but it's like a strong
detachment between the two.

27
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.349
So, sorry, let me rephrase that,
&gt;&gt; Brian: If the most parent

28
00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.580
is having issues, you can eliminate the
children that's causing the issue, right?

29
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.510
Because the children have no way to
interact with the parent, right?

30
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.720
So the problem has to live within the
parent, that's what I wanted to assert.

31
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.750
So, in our particular case,
right, if I have search and

32
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.120
maybe Search is having an issue here.

33
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.500
I can already rest assured that ShowCard
isn't causing any issues because ShowCard

34
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.150
has no way to meddle with Search, right?

35
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.970
That's the power of one-way data flow.

36
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.394
So this is a powerful thing that I
think Facebook does really well,

37
00:02:19.394 --> 00:02:23.423
in particular with React and
some of their other libraries,

38
00:02:23.423 --> 00:02:27.782
is they really optimize for
debug ability and maintainability.

39
00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:33.198
And so this idea that you can see
a problem and eliminate entire

40
00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:39.672
swaths of your code where that problem
could not be, is really powerful.

41
00:02:39.672 --> 00:02:44.021
Cuz you can start having an issue, and you
just get to eliminate two-thirds of your

42
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:48.390
app, and you just get to instantly start
looking within that one-third, right?

43
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.530
It's really, really powerful.

44
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.350
So that's props, that's one-way data flow.

45
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.630
It's definitely a core tenant of React.
