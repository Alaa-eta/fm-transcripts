>> Brian Holt: So it's really great if we can make react-router handle both service-side routing and client-side routing. And the answer is you can, that does work. So let's go ahead and go do that.
>> Brian Holt: So there's a couple things that we're gonna have to do first. So open your App.jsx.

[00:00:25]
The thing that we have here on the outside is browser router. Right? As it might imply by the name, browser router depends on a browser, right? And if we try and run browser router in node, node doesn't have the document, it doesn't have window, doesn't have all these things.

[00:00:40]
So if you try and run browser router in node it's going to fail. So in other words this is going to be a client site concern so we are going to have to move it to client app. Right? So go ahead and take out browser writer. And so provider is the top level component.

[00:00:57]
And that's fine. Redux works both in node and in the browser. Get rid of browser router up here and then go up to client app.jsx and what you are gonna do here is you're just going to import browser router from react-router-dom. Okay, and then you are just going to surround app with browser router.

[00:01:34]

>> Brian Holt: And that's it.
>> Brian Holt: You can put that on multiple lines, if that makes you feel better. Like that. So now browser router is only going to be rendered on the client. That frees us up on the node side, to use a different kind of router, which is gonna be, I think the static router.

[00:01:58]
Something like that, we'll figure it out.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, the next thing I want you to do, is I want you to open your index.HTML, which you haven't edited for long time. What we wanna do here is we wanna edit this so that, this is going to be used as the template as well.

[00:02:28]
And there is 10 billion ways to do the template here. I'm not actually super concerned of how you choose to do the templating. Right? We need to use this, and we need to insert mark up into this, right, in order for this to work. I'm going to use low dash templating just because it's really simple.

[00:02:44]
But again, you could use handlebars. You could just write template stings yourself,like there's a million ways to do it, and isn't really not important. So lodash templates are really easy, I'm just gonna say this, which is gonna be angle bracket percent equals, I'm gonna put body here and then I'm going to hit percent,

[00:03:07]

>> Brian Holt: Then closing angle bracket.
>> Brian Holt: And this is just gonna say whenever I go to render this template, this is going to put body in there, right?
>> Brian Holt: You can actually use React, itself, to do templating here. That's fine, as well. It's just a little bit more work than I care to do right now.
