00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
while you were on a lunch,

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.930
I figured out the styled components issue,
so let's go back and do that real quick.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.330
So, when we did flow-type, again,
this is kind of a nascent ecosystem here.

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.240
So we're still kind of figuring out how
to get this to all play nicely together.

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.825
When we did flow-typed install,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: it

6
00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:27.045
was able to go out and
grab almost all the definitions,

7
00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:30.940
except one, which is the one
definition that we were ignoring.

8
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.880
So now the flow had no concept of this,
and was also being ignored.

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.890
So it just assumed that
module did not exist.

10
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.382
And the reason why is,

11
00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:45.324
Styles components was updated maybe two
days before we started this course, and so

12
00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:49.217
I updated it cuz I wanted to be
using the latest and greatest tech.

13
00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:53.634
Unfortunately, they haven't had
time to release new types for

14
00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:57.411
version 2, they only have a type for
version 1.4.

15
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.212
However, the API that we
are going to be using,

16
00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:04.640
we're not using many of the new features
or any of the new features really.

17
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.191
So we can go ahead and use the old
type definitions and be mostly fine.

18
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:12.899
So I want you to go in
to your command line,

19
00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:20.975
I want you to type flow-typed
install styled-components@1.4,

20
00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:29.053
I think that should work.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Honestly,

21
00:01:29.053 --> 00:01:33.643
you can probably just do 1.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No,

22
00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:37.143
do 1.4.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

23
00:01:37.143 --> 00:01:40.738
that'll give you the types for
1.46, I think.

24
00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:42.362
Is that what it says?

25
00:01:42.362 --> 00:01:45.170
No, it just doesn't say, okay, so 1.4.

26
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.569
And that should be sufficient for
what we're using,

27
00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.000
despite the fact that we're using two.

28
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.940
So, a little bit of a dangerous operation,
right?

29
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.600
But it's gonna work.

30
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.271
So, just rest assure that I've been down

31
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:59.847
this path.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

32
00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:03.090
now if we say yarn flow, it should work.

33
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.640
So we can get rid of this.

34
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:13.280
I had right here // $FlowFixMe which it
says like, ignore the next line, right?

35
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.884
But we can get rid of that now and

36
00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:21.383
everything should be working.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You should be seeing

37
00:02:21.383 --> 00:02:29.135
no errors.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

38
00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:30.230
any questions about that?

39
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.550
Any questions about types or
anything like that, in general?

40
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.370
So I've only shown you
a couple ways of doing typing.

41
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.980
But we're gonna keep going and
doing more and more types as we go.

42
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.300
So we'll be learning little bits and

43
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.440
pieces about how to do specific type of
adaptations and some of the advantages

44
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.000
that you can get from the typing
system that we now have in place.

45
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.700
Again, none of this is required.

46
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.400
There's no problem if you
just decide to remove add

47
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.510
flow from all of your documents and
just keep going without types.

48
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.360
So I don't want for you to think that
this is a required part of React because

49
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.910
it's definitely not, nor
is it necessary tied to React.

50
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.307
You can write angular
projects with Flow as well.
