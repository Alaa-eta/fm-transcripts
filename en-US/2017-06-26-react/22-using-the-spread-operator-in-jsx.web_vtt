00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:03.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I wanna show you
something, I have it here in my notes.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.650
But ultimately I think
this is an anti pattern so

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.790
we're gonna leave it the way it is.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.600
Well, up to you.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.680
So if we go back to search,

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.490
notice how we're passing in show
as one entire object, right?

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.515
Well, it would be kind of nice if
we could do kind of passing all of

8
00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:29.216
the,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All

9
00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:32.150
the different properties
as top level items, right?

10
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.630
So instead of saying props.show.title that
we could just say props.title, right?

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.570
So there's a couple
ways you could do that.

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.040
You could totally just say
title equals show.title, right?

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.510
And pass in each one of them individually.

14
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.170
Totally would work.

15
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.300
There's another way to do this.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.960
And it's kind of an anti pattern, but

17
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.970
I'm going to show you how to do it because
I'm sure you're going to run into it.

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.930
You can say ...show.

19
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.290
This is called the object
spread which is not yet

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.820
a part of JavaScript or
at least let me rephrase that.

21
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.490
This is specific to JSX, but it's
emulating this object spread operator,

22
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.714
which is stage three,
I believe now for JavaScript.

23
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.554
The array spread is a part of JavaScript,
the object spread is forthcoming.

24
00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:32.454
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is just saying,
rather than me saying title equals

25
00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:36.297
show.title description equals
show.description is just saying spread all

26
00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:38.760
that stuff out, and so
it's all top level items.

27
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.552
So if we do this, in fact we'll just do it
for now so you can just see how it's done.

28
00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:47.000
Now we going to go back here and

29
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.730
everywhere it says show like that,
we get to eliminate.

30
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.883
So now it just says,
and yep, that one, too.

31
00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:01.503
And rather than show being a shape,
we're just gonna delete that and

32
00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:05.020
delete that, and
now they're all top level items.

33
00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:12.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

34
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:20.386
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So a place where I would
be okay using the spread operator is

35
00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:25.290
when I know what the shape of
every single item is, right?

36
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.730
I know everything that's in that item.

37
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.010
The place where you run into problems is,
let's say that inside of this data.json.

38
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.340
In fact,
it's kind of already happening, right?

39
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.429
So we have this imdbID right, that's
being passed down into our show card now.

40
00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:46.350
I guess it kind of was before cuz it
was a tag along in the show item.

41
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.600
But that's being passed
on to the show card, and

42
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.910
the ShowCard does not need it,
which is kind of a problem.

43
00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:59.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a problem in the sense
of you're moving around a bunch of data

44
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.850
that you don't have to,
and it's just messy.

45
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.580
It's messy coding.

46
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.830
It's not being very explicit.

47
00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:12.672
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So in this particular case
it might make sense to you just say,

48
00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:14.980
actually go out and list each one of them.

49
00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:20.151
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean if there's one thing
I've learned over the years of coding it's

50
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:22.160
that usually being explicit is worth it.

51
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.560
Even at the cost of writing more code.

52
00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:27.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So up to you.

53
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.310
We'll leave it for now.

54
00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:32.479
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
that's what that looks like.

55
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But it's sounds like prop
types is okay with extra attributes.

56
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
That's not gonna complain.

57
00:03:41.913 --> 00:03:44.993
So and
we have a new thing here kinda showing up.

58
00:03:44.993 --> 00:03:51.255
Now if you did the at,
go back to ShowCard and

59
00:03:51.255 --> 00:03:57.361
give it a shape so
we can shut up the linter.

60
00:03:57.361 --> 00:04:00.020
Now we don't need shape anymore,
we just need string.
