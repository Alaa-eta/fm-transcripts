00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How would you use Redux
with something like local storage?

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.440
Have you done that before?

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.810
&gt;&gt; Brian: So you can definitely dump
your state to local storage, and

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.530
then load it back.

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.230
So you can hydrate and
re-hydrate from any number of sources.

6
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.910
There are plugins specifically, I think
it's called Redux Offline if I remember

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.950
correctly, that'll do a bunch
of that stuff for you.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.140
I'm not gonna show you here
because I haven't done it, and

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.610
I'm not gonna improvise on the fly.

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.428
But there's a bunch of tooling and
libraries

11
00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:36.769
around Redux that will do that for
you, for sure.

12
00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.621
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then with Redux,
so essentially instead of setState,

13
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:42.322
you're using Dispatch?

14
00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:44.117
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yep, that's astute.

15
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.083
&gt;&gt; Brian: The interesting thing with
React, which I have not shown you, is you

16
00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:58.880
can actually do reducers, and actions,
and things like that with React directly.

17
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.068
So you can kinda treat React state
as if it was a mini Redux store.

18
00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:07.706
That's possible cuz instead
of giving React objects to

19
00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:12.749
update the state with,
you can actually hand it functions.

20
00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:15.858
And those functions can be like reducers,
right?

21
00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:19.507
So that's possible as well.

22
00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:21.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I've got a couple
questions regarding flow.

23
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.840
So are we going to end up creating
a type definition for our state?

24
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.460
Cuz right now you kind of just
evaporated what our state is.

25
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.710
There's nothing that tells us
the shape of our state tree, right?

26
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.703
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:48.050
Sort of, [LAUGH] I think is
the answer to your question.

28
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.560
So it's smart enough to say
that this is a string here.

29
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.303
And by setting the default state to
string, it's going to be a string.

30
00:01:57.303 --> 00:01:59.620
And so if we ever modify it
from being a string, it knows.

31
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.444
It's like hey, you messed this up.

32
00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:05.441
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, so our entire state
hierarchy right now is just a string,

33
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:05.966
right?

34
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:06.842
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yep.

35
00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:07.469
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We're all good.

36
00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But
what happens when we add more stuff?

37
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.040
&gt;&gt; Brian: I will show you.

38
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.445
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Maybe, okay.

39
00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:15.292
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then the other Flow

40
00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:21.334
question is,
why prefer declare type over interface?

41
00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:22.359
&gt;&gt; Brian: With Flow?

42
00:02:26.797 --> 00:02:28.188
&gt;&gt; Brian: I don't know if I know
the answer to that question.

43
00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:28.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, don't worry.

44
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.040
&gt;&gt; Brian: The answer to that question is,
this is the way I've done it.

45
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.500
So there might be a good reason to
do that, and I'm not super sure.

46
00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:48.615
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool, but I would be interested
in the answer to the question for sure.

47
00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:51.856
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
then someone's asking about,

48
00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:57.480
just if you could pull up
the changes you made to createStore?

49
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.231
And, I mean, if you pushed a branch
then he could just see it there too.

50
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.368
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, I can do that too
before we move on to async Redux.

51
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:13.010
&gt;&gt; Brian: But again, this is precisely
pulled off of the dev tools as well.

52
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.640
So you could just copy and paste off
the website, which is exactly what I did.

53
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.710
Yeah, but I will push a branch.
