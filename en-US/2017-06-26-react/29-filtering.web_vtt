WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's actually use search term, right?

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.530
Right now,
we're not really doing anything with it.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.732
I just wanted to show you that
if we replace this.state.search

4
00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:14.430
term here inside of the h1, and
then we come back over here

5
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.360
to our nice little thing right here.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.586
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice that we
have nothing left there, and

7
00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:30.530
then as soon as I start typing
it's echoed over here, right?

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.351
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this data is bound
to this one, so whatever is in

9
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:42.278
the input it's also gonna
be input over there, right?

10
00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:46.230
So this kind of bends back to
what I was talking about earlier.

11
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.770
You have to think of React components in
terms of, given a certain set of state and

12
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.890
a certain set of props, this is what
it is going to look like, right?

13
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.030
So you think about React in
terms of snapshots, right?

14
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.290
Given this snapshot of props and

15
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.550
this snapshot of state my reaction point
is always going to look like this.

16
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.270
It's deterministically going
to look like this, right?

17
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.360
Every single time given this state and
given this props,

18
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.650
it's always going to look this way.

19
00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:18.029
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now what's advantageous
about thinking about your component in

20
00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:22.227
this particular light, is you get to
eliminate the axis of time, right?

21
00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:26.360
So I'm sure many of you have debugged
a problem with like jQuery or Angular or

22
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.622
something like that, where you have,
I've had to click this button then this

23
00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:34.200
button then this button, and
then this broke over here, right?

24
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.454
So you had to go through these series of
just like weirdness to get to eventually

25
00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:39.620
this stage, right?

26
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.455
You have to think about events over time
leading to this particular problem, right?

27
00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:49.020
With React components, it's just really
given this state this breaks, right?

28
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.806
And I feel like that's a much
more simple thing to think about,

29
00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:57.736
because you no longer have to think about
going through periods of time to arrive at

30
00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:59.248
a single point, right?

31
00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:03.264
It's just, if I put this state into
this component, it just breaks or

32
00:02:03.264 --> 00:02:04.910
it doesn't break, right?

33
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.237
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yes, that's what I
wanted to demonstrate to you here.

34
00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:19.300
That given this state, right, where this
state it's going to look like this right?

35
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.906
So when the state looks like this
that component is always going

36
00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:25.308
to look like that, does that make sense?

37
00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:29.270
Cool, Okay so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a few

38
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.540
minor-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

39
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Questions and chat.

40
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.480
Amir is asking could you
recap why the file names

41
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.580
are jsx instead of js,
conversion to they're all js.

42
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.865
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The answer to that question
is, in version two they're all js,

43
00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:55.310
because that's where it seemed like
things were going with Create React App.

44
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.530
Create React App enforces .js.

45
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.310
And then we switch to the Airbnb
style rules, which enforces JSX.

46
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.560
And version one was JSX as well, [LAUGH].

47
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.250
So in other words, no one's really
decided yet where it's gonna be.

48
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.290
And I just went with what Airbnb decided.

49
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.240
So yeah, that's why it is.

50
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.690
It's because the Airbnb
rules enforce that.

51
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And could you recap the
trade-off using the constructor versus?

52
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I just think
this is more succinct, right?

53
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.167
If you use the constructor method,
that's valid ES6 today and

54
00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:33.160
this is using a stage two proposal.

55
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.760
So I like this better,
because I find it easier to read.

56
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.090
The other reason why it's
going to be beneficial is,

57
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.900
because when we get into flow types,

58
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.730
flow can understand this better, which we
will talk about that when we get to flow.

59
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Would we have to use
a constructor if this component

60
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.355
was accessing props?

61
00:03:57.355 --> 00:04:00.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope.

62
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.420
So I see what you're saying,

63
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.464
because you have to call super
props inside of constructor.

64
00:04:04.464 --> 00:04:08.920
So you're overriding your React
constructor if you write your own

65
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.300
constructor, so

66
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.060
the default React constructor will
take care of the props for you.

67
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.798
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.

68
00:04:20.412 --> 00:04:21.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any more?

69
00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:31.040
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so this is probably
the last thing we will do today.

70
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.590
Let's talk about, or
let's actually use search term

71
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.580
Rather than just being something
cute that displays at the top.

72
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.860
What I wanna do is,
given some search term, some search term.

73
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.370
So if I type black, right?

74
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.540
I only want Black Mirror to show up,
right?

75
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.780
So I wanna be able to search in real-time
my various shows that I have up here.

76
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.710
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna do something a little clever.

77
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.480
So we have preload.shows, right, and

78
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.130
we're using that to map out
to a set of components.

79
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.923
So if I want to show less components, I
can do a little bit more functional fill,

80
00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:16.801
and I could just filter it before I map,
right?

81
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:20.787
So I can just filter out the ones I don't
want based on that search term, and

82
00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.890
then only display the ones that I want.

83
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.611
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what I'm gonna do here,
is I'm gonna say dot,

84
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:32.301
before I call a .map,
I'm gonna call .filter.

85
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.890
And what I'm gonna do here
is I'm gonna pass in a show.

86
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.240
So let's filter, if I return true for

87
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.990
any given item it's gonna
keep it in the array.

88
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.930
If I return false,
it's gonna take it out of the array.

89
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.830
So if I did false right here, right?

90
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.080
I would get nothing, right?

91
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.980
If I put true here,
I would get everything, right?

92
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.410
So what I'm gonna do here,
is I'm gonna check to see if

93
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.144
the search term exist in either
the title or the description, right?

94
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.572
So I wanna know are you in the title,
so show.title or

95
00:06:11.572 --> 00:06:16.929
the show.description, show.description.

96
00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:26.884
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then I'm gonna say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

97
00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:29.932
I think this is the best way to do it,
whatever.

98
00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:33.098
I wanna be case insensitive, right?

99
00:06:33.098 --> 00:06:38.969
So I'm gonna say two uppercase,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .indexOf,

100
00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:42.870
so I'm gonna check if it
exist anywhere in the string.

101
00:06:45.414 --> 00:06:48.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's gonna be
this.state.searchTerm, right?

102
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.321
So I'm gonna check if this .searchTerm
exists inside of the show which

103
00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:56.228
I'm also gonna put the uppercase, right?

104
00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:58.440
Because I wanna make this thing
totally case insensitive.

105
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.240
And then I'm just gonna check to see
if it's greater than or equal to zero.

106
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:08.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That should be a dot.

107
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.170
This is a little dense.

108
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.660
You could pull this out if
this made you feel better, but

109
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.270
let's just kind of recap here, right?

110
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.160
So filter, right?

111
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.309
We're doing a filter on this.

112
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.870
This I'm putting show title and show
description in one string together, right?

113
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.890
So I can check both the description and
the title.

114
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.829
I can put it in either order
doesn't really matter, okay?

115
00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:39.222
I'm putting them to uppercase,

116
00:07:39.222 --> 00:07:42.510
because I wanna take case
sensitivity out of the question.

117
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.002
And then asking in this
uppercase string right here,

118
00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:49.579
can you find search term,
also in uppercase, right?

119
00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:54.653
Because indexOf is gonna give you
somewhere if it's greater than or

120
00:07:54.653 --> 00:07:57.890
equal to zero, it exists in the string.

121
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.120
And if it doesn't exist in the string,
its gonna return -1, right?

122
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.635
So true if it's in the string, or
false if its not in the string, right?

123
00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:08.710
And that's what we're
gonna be filtering on.

124
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do we feel about that?

125
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.651
It's a little dense, but this is
a good way of hacking a search, right?

126
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:20.232
This isn't exactly Elasticsearch.

127
00:08:20.232 --> 00:08:22.918
I think their algorithm is a little
bit more sophisticated, but

128
00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:25.360
this will do the job for what we're doing.

129
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.746
So now if I type black,
it's only gonna show Black Mirror and

130
00:08:29.746 --> 00:08:31.989
Orange is the New Black right?

131
00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:38.925
If I'll type house, it's gonna type House
of Cards or game, I got Game Of Thrones.

132
00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:49.763
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Come on,
that's pretty cool, right?

133
00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:51.077
Pretty cool?
Pretty cool.

134
00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:52.752
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.

135
00:08:52.752 --> 00:08:57.290
[LAUGH]
So this is what I'm getting at and

136
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.890
what I keep harping on,
is given this state and given these props,

137
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.910
this is what this component looks like,
right?

138
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:08.880
So with the snapshot that,
here's a good way of doing it, right?

139
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.172
So we can set the default state.

140
00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:12.126
So if I put game right here and I save it,

141
00:09:12.126 --> 00:09:14.450
what's going to be
rendered on first render?

142
00:09:17.543 --> 00:09:18.791
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just Game of Thrones,
right?

143
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:22.235
So given that snapshot where
the search term is game, and

144
00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:25.260
then it's only gonna be
showing Game of Thrones.

145
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.101
And then as soon as I delete it,
I get everything back.

146
00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:32.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that make sense?

147
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.120
This is like,
it only took me six god damn hours, but

148
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.100
we eventually got to the point why
I think React is amazing, right?

149
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.690
Cuz I think this is a really
powerful intuitive and

150
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.750
performant way of writing JavaScript.

151
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.150
I think it's a way to write scalable apps.

152
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.244
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And the interesting things
is like, you can come back later, and

153
00:09:55.244 --> 00:09:59.268
I mean barring this, I'd probably abstract
this out into some sort of module or

154
00:09:59.268 --> 00:10:01.980
something actually
a little bit more robust.

155
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.550
But barring this little mess right here,

156
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.570
this is actually pretty easy
to read through, right?

157
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.990
It's pretty intuitive.

158
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.130
That given this state you
get this sort of output.

159
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.600
I find it easy to use the term du jour,
reason about, right?

160
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:26.189
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions?

161
00:10:31.517 --> 00:10:36.058
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, this is one of the
things that just really made me realize

162
00:10:36.058 --> 00:10:39.670
like, this is great,
I wanna keep writing this.

163
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.810
Someone pointed out to me the other day
that the posters are of uneven size,

164
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.275
and now I can't unsee it.

165
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.688
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Do you push?

166
00:10:52.688 --> 00:10:53.967
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, definitely.

167
00:10:53.967 --> 00:10:59.198
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a few people who
are missing something along the way,

168
00:10:59.198 --> 00:11:01.145
so-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Easy to do,

169
00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:03.673
I mean, we're writing a pretty
big app together, so.

170
00:11:03.673 --> 00:11:07.937
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I love how
many people have written into us,

171
00:11:07.937 --> 00:11:11.321
how this course gave them a job, right?

172
00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:14.721
Cuz it's like so
real-world that people got,

173
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:18.124
now know how to build
the React production app.

174
00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:21.070
And they're like,
I got this job because of it, right?

175
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:21.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's super rewarding.

176
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.098
So I was at a user group,

177
00:11:25.098 --> 00:11:31.850
the Modern Web Meetup Group
in San Jose last week.

178
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:36.283
Some guy was on the phone, it was
a little rude but it was pretty cool too.

179
00:11:36.283 --> 00:11:40.443
Walks up to me and says, hey I got a job
at Facebook because of your course and

180
00:11:40.443 --> 00:11:41.774
then just like ran off.

181
00:11:41.774 --> 00:11:47.850
[LAUGH] So I was like thank you, or
you're welcome, or damn it, I don't know.

182
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.141
I was both offended and bewildered,
and honored all at the same time.

183
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:53.363
So more honored, it was super cool.

184
00:11:53.363 --> 00:11:55.250
No it's awesome to hear
that kind of stuff.

185
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.182
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, but the whole point
of that is that software development is

186
00:11:58.182 --> 00:11:58.885
hard, right?

187
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:02.549
This stuff, building a real-world
application is difficult.

188
00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:04.550
There's a lot of moving pieces.

189
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's sort of

190
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.450
demystifying each piece,
especially with the videos,

191
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.880
people can kind of come back to it and
all that.

192
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For sure.

193
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But
it is daunting, cuz it is hard.

194
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.360
And that's why people get paid a lot
of money to write this kind of stuff.

195
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For sure.

196
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.740
For sure, and that's why this
class is structured the way it is.

197
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.976
I like exercises that I leave for
you to do on your own, and

198
00:12:27.976 --> 00:12:30.105
connect the dots yourself.

199
00:12:30.105 --> 00:12:31.839
That's more useful for,
I feel like algorithms, and

200
00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:33.092
like little bite size pieces, right?

201
00:12:33.092 --> 00:12:37.605
We're talking about modern
application development, and

202
00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:40.000
like that's not in exercises.

203
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.430
Okay, build a Netflix app, go and
I'm just gonna sit over here, right?

204
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.284
That doesn't work, right?

205
00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:46.443
We need to sit down together and
build things.

206
00:12:46.443 --> 00:12:50.160
And it's useful for you to type things
even if you don't understand them,

207
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.163
because at least for

208
00:12:51.163 --> 00:12:55.430
me the act of typing something like helps
me connect dots in my brain, right?

209
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.914
Especially like, I put all pieces
together and then I step back.

210
00:12:57.914 --> 00:12:59.950
It's like, okay,
now I see that it was a puzzle.

211
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.240
It's a picture or something.
