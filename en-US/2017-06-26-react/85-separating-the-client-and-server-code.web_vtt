00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's really great if
we can make react-router handle both

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.090
service-side routing and
client-side routing.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.970
And the answer is you can, that does work.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.330
So let's go ahead and go do that.

5
00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:17.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's a couple things
that we're gonna have to do first.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.540
So open your App.jsx.

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.880
The thing that we have here on
the outside is browser router.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.040
Right?

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.450
As it might imply by the name, browser
router depends on a browser, right?

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.380
And if we try and run browser router in
node, node doesn't have the document,

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.920
it doesn't have window,
doesn't have all these things.

12
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.290
So if you try and run browser
router in node it's going to fail.

13
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.210
So in other words this is going
to be a client site concern so

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.280
we are going to have to
move it to client app.

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.100
Right?

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.030
So go ahead and take out browser writer.

17
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.550
And so
provider is the top level component.

18
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.590
And that's fine.

19
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.810
Redux works both in node and
in the browser.

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.752
Get rid of browser router up here and

21
00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:13.200
then go up to client app.jsx and

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.142
what you are gonna do here is you're

23
00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:23.086
just going to import browser router

24
00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:27.071
from react-router-dom.

25
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:31.042
Okay, and then you are just going to
surround app with browser router.

26
00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:35.296
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's it.

27
00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:41.273
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can put
that on multiple lines,

28
00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:42.210
if that makes you feel better.

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.110
Like that.

30
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.100
So now browser router is only going
to be rendered on the client.

31
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.940
That frees us up on the node side,

32
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.273
to use a different kind of router, which
is gonna be, I think the static router.

33
00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:04.239
Something like that, we'll figure it out.

34
00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:12.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, the next thing I
want you to do, is I want you to open

35
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.137
your index.HTML,
which you haven't edited for long time.

36
00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:23.396
What we wanna do here is
we wanna edit this so that,

37
00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:28.720
this is going to be used
as the template as well.

38
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.550
And there is 10 billion ways
to do the template here.

39
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.860
I'm not actually super concerned of
how you choose to do the templating.

40
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.590
Right?

41
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.110
We need to use this, and we need to insert
mark up into this, right, in order for

42
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.600
this to work.

43
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.570
I'm going to use low dash templating
just because it's really simple.

44
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.270
But again, you could use handlebars.

45
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.120
You could just write template
stings yourself,like there's

46
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.820
a million ways to do it, and
isn't really not important.

47
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.380
So lodash templates are really easy,
I'm just gonna say this,

48
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.606
which is gonna be angle bracket percent
equals, I'm gonna put body here and

49
00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:10.800
then I'm going to hit percent,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then closing angle bracket.

50
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.946
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is just gonna say
whenever I go to render this template,

51
00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.215
this is going to put body in there, right?

52
00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:23.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can actually use React,
itself, to do templating here.

53
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.220
That's fine, as well.

54
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.400
It's just a little bit more work
than I care to do right now.
