[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: Now, we kinda have our bare bones set up here. So, let's actually start writing some react cuz so far what we have, this is not a very good intro to react. So here, instead of my complete intro to react, I'm going to create a new file. And it's going to be called Index.html.

[00:00:29]

>> Brian Holt: Okay, I'm gonna put the bare bones for an HTML document. .HTML:5. So I'm using something called emit, which is kind of outside the scope of this class, but it's super useful. Used to be called zen coding. It's just like a bunch of shortcuts for writing HTML really fast.

[00:00:54]
Which is how I scaffolded that out. We're gonna create a file and I'm gonna call it svideo you can call, that's what I named my little app here. You can call your video app whatever you wanna call it. Here we're going to put a div, and its ID is gonna be called app.

[00:01:21]

>> Brian Holt: And then we're going to do two things right here. We're gonna put two script tags, one of them is going to be equal to node_modules/react/dist/react.js. So we're gonna be pulling in the pre-bundled react file, so that we can play with it, without doing any sort of bundling.

[00:01:51]
And then the other thing we're gonna do, is we're gonna do another script tag.
>> Brian Holt: 'node_modules' /react-dom/dist/react-dom.js. So here's a big key about react here. I imagine a lot of you have heard of things like React Native and React VR deframe react omission. There's a bunch of them, right?

[00:02:24]
So, you can think of reacting kind of split into two parts. Meaning, if you're gonna use react, you're always gonna have to require two different libraries. There is a top level react part, which is the same across react native, react dom, react everything. This is the library where we actually create components.

[00:02:41]
And has the life cycle methods, it has all these different things that you as a developer interact with. And then, between react and whatever you're rendering to, there sits a glue layer, right? That translates react components to DOM nodes or to Native UI elements. So that's what React Native is, that's what ReactDOM is, it's these different glue layers, the rendering layers.

[00:03:08]
So we're gonna actually be coding with react, but at the very end we'll pull in ReactDOM to actually render out to the DOM. So that's why there are two separate libraries. It used to be the same thing up until, like react.12, maybe. No, don't quote me on that.

[00:03:28]
So, underneath that we're gonna do a script tag. So when we pull these in, React and ReactDom, it's gonna make them available as a global Variable that we can refer to. So now we have react and react-dom. So the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna say const, MyFirstComponent, and it's gonna just be a function.

[00:04:03]

>> Brian Holt: And we're gonna say return React.createElement('div', null,). And I'm gonna do some kind of funky spacing here, but it'll make sense in a moment why I did that. Then here I'm going to say React.creatEelement('h1', null, 'This is my first component!') or whatever you wanna render out.
>> Brian Holt: Okay.

[00:04:46]

>> Brian Holt: Then here at the bottom, I'm gonna say, ReactDOM.render.
>> Brian Holt: And we're gonna say React.createElements(MyFirstComponent). And then we're gonna tell where to render. So, in this case we want to render up here in the app id, so we're gonna say, document.getElementById('app').
>> Brian Holt: So I'll explain it momentarily, but let's go and make sure that I'm not full of shit and it actually works.

[00:05:34]
There's always a distinct possibility that I'm making things up. So I'm gonna literally just open the file with my browser. Eventually, we'll get to serving with a server, whatever, but this will work for now. Let's see, so I need to go to talks, no, there we go, index.html.

[00:06:00]
And you can see here it says This is my first component, right? This is React at it's most base level. And that's all you're gonna learn in this workshop, so wrap it up, we're done. Just kidding. Well, I mean, sort of. No, I am kidding [LAUGH]. Okay, so let's talk about what's going on here.

[00:06:26]
So here we're creating a react component. This is called MyFirstComponent. What you can think of like a blueprint for creating new components. Or for those of you who like the Java E, Class E, project orientedness, this is a class. And we can create many instances of this class.

[00:06:43]
So, we have created a reusable component here that every time that we render it out, so if I inspect this element right here
>> Brian Holt: You can see here there is a div and a h1. So every time that I create a new like stamp, a new instance of this MyFirstComponent is going to render out this particular bit of markup.

[00:07:08]
Now, this isn't really super interesting right now, like it's really just a div and an H1. It would have been way easier to just me going in here and say, okay, I'm gonna put a div right here. But where's the fun in that? I wanted to over engineer it.

[00:07:25]
Now hopefully this is indicative to you that at it's most base layer, there's not really a lot to react. The hello world to react is what, this is gonna be ten lines of code. So, let's go in and talk about React.createElement then. So this function right here is a class.

[00:07:49]
It's the my first component class. Create element is creating a particular element of something. So I'm creating one div instance. I'm not creating a new type of div. This is just rendering out a div. Same thing here with this H1. Then here I call createElement, same thing right here, I'm creating an instance of my first component.

[00:08:14]
So I could create another component which renders out yet more of my first component. So they can be, components can be composed of other components as well. Any questions about this example so far? Not super useful yet, but we're getting to the useful part, promise.
>> Brian Holt: So let's actually go create another type of component.

[00:08:40]
So, I'm gonna create another one called My Title. So const Mytitle, it's gonna be another function.
>> Brian Holt: And what this is gonna do is it's going return more markup.
>> Brian Holt: So I'm gonna say React.createElement('div', null). And were gonna say React.createElement('h1', h2). So something that you might be noting here, if I pass the string it's actually going to render out, that sort of tag.

[00:09:28]
It's not even really gonna keep track of what it is. I could put 'x-my-component' and it would render out an x-my-component tag. So this also works with web components if you want to go down that path. If I pass it like a variable name like this MyFirstComponent, it's not a string, it's a MyFirstComponent.

[00:09:50]
It's actually going to render out that it's going to assume that it's a react component and try to render it out that way.
>> Brian Holt: And this is gonna be my second component. And then we're gonna modify this down here. What's cool about this is, createElement, so I'm gonna put MyTitle in here.

[00:10:23]
But I can actually put multiple Myitles in here.
>> Brian Holt: So for those of you that like the computer science terms, createElement has variable errity, right? So you can give it as many perimeters as you want, that's all that that stupid term means. [LAUGH]
>> Brian Holt: Yeah so we're going to be creating multiple instances of MyTitle.

[00:10:48]
The other thing that you can do with this is you can give it an array. You can give it an array of react instead of the elements, right? Right now this isn't super important. They kind of look the same, but this will become important later in the course.

[00:11:04]
So, just keep in mind that you can also pass it, arrays of components. So let's go try and make sure that that works. You can see here I got a bunch of instances of my second component.
