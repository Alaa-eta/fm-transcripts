[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: Go ahead.
>> Speaker 2: Quick question, what are the inputs and outputs of mapStateToProps in dispatch to props? What's sort of the overall purpose of them? I mean, what are they doing?
>> Brian Holt: They're returning objects, right? Right, this is an object. So if you want to make this a little bit more verbose, it's gonna look like this.

[00:00:35]

>> Brian Holt: All right, this is what it actually looks like.
>> Speaker 2: And who eventually uses that object?
>> Brian Holt: So this is the object, and you remember how we did something like,
>> Brian Holt: This right here, ...show. What's taking this object and spreading it over the component, that's precisely what's happening here at the search.

[00:00:56]
It's taking this object and spreading this object over search, right? So everything that I put in here is going to be passed as a prop to search. So search term is now a prop of search because of this.
>> Speaker 2: Okay.
>> Brian Holt: So if I put blah: 5, right, now I'd have inside of props, I could reference props.blah, and I would get 5, right?

[00:01:23]
It's just passing props into search.
>> Speaker 2: Okay, great, and then the dispatch is?
>> Brian Holt: It's a function that Redux gives you to pass actions into the reducers. That make sense?
>> Speaker 3: Does that have use beyond wiring up event handlers usually?
>> Brian Holt: What is it?
>> Speaker 3: mapDispatchToProps, does it have use beyond wiring up event handlers, no?

[00:02:00]

>> Brian Holt: Well, mapDispatchToProps, does it have more uses than that?
>> Brian Holt: I mean, you can kick off asynchronous actions, and we'll talk about that tomorrow with asynch actions.
>> Brian Holt: But it's gonna be kicking off actions. That's the point of mapDispatchToProps, is it's translating events in the UI to actions into the Redux store, that's the whole purpose.

[00:02:28]

>> Speaker 3: Does the redux state object get too complicated over time?
>> Brian Holt: I'm gonna show you how to silo it tomorrow. So that despite the fact that that tree can become quite large, you're only gonna be working on very small slices at a time, so it keeps it pretty manageable.

[00:02:47]
It can get complicated, but with discipline and kind of enforcing some rules on yourself, it can be fine, even with giant stores.
