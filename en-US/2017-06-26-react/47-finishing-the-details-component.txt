[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: So let's go and make Details actually look like a nice page, right? Cuz right now it's just kinda outputting data. So we're gonna make this an actual method. Does anyone have any questions? It's a good question to ask them, or a good time to ask.
>> Brian Holt: Okay?

[00:00:29]
Yeah, go ahead.
>> Speaker 2: How does types.jsx get imported again?
>> Brian Holt: It's automatically imported because it's in the flow-typed directory.
>> Speaker 2: So when you add the comment on the top, it just imports all of it?
>> Brian Holt: Yep, yep, yep, yep. It's kinda magical. There are ways to do it that you don't have to go through flow-typed, but that's just an established cow path, so I tend to follow that.

[00:01:00]
Okay, so const { title, description,
>> Brian Holt: year, poster, trailer } = props.shows. Nope, show rather.
>> Brian Holt: If you've never seen this before, this is called destructuring, which came with ES6. ES2015 as well. It's basically saying, inside of props.show, I know I have a variable called title. Pull it out, and call it title.

[00:01:39]
If you wanted to write it the long way, this would be const title = props.show.title. Const description equals, etc, etc, etc, right? This is just shorthand for that.
>> Brian Holt: Now it's gonna be yelling me. It's like hey, I don't have prop type validations for this. But, pretty easy for us to do.

[00:02:01]
We can say props. And we're gonna say, you're gonna be getting a show, which is a Show.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, now they look like there's still errors, but that's because we haven't used them yet, which ESLint doesn't like. Sometimes it's kinda hard to figure out who's yelling at you now.

[00:02:28]
[LAUGH] But, as I promised, it is all worth it. Okay, so what we're gonna do here, is we're gonna delete all this, cuz we don't need it anymore. And we're gonna make a header.
>> Brian Holt: Which is gonna be an h1 with svideo, so you have a nice header again.

[00:02:47]
Then underneath that, we're gonna put a section.
>> Brian Holt: With a h1-
>> Speaker 2: [COUGH]
>> Brian Holt: Bless you. h1 with {title}. h2,
>> Brian Holt: With {year}.
>> Brian Holt: And again, if you remember, we wanted this literally surrounded with parenthesis around the year. So we're just gonna put parenthesis around that.
>> Brian Holt: We're gonna have an img src=

[00:03:25]

>> Brian Holt: {'/public/img/posters/${poster}'}. And then we're gonna give it an alt, because we're good citizens of the Internet. And then we're gonna say, Poster for ${title}.
>> Brian Holt: Not only does putting an alt tag, that's already important for accessibility. In fact, there's a great Front End Masters course by John on accessibility that you all should definitely watch.

[00:04:03]
Because we are all deficient at accessibility. But also AirBnB, the ES centrals will enforce on you to write those alt texts. So, you have to. [LAUGH]
>> Brian Holt: Okay, and then here we're going to do a description as well.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, underneath this section we're gonna do a div.

[00:04:41]

>> Brian Holt: And then here, we're gonna do something kinda fun. We're gonna put an iframe, cuz who doesn't love iframes?
>> Brian Holt: But we're actually going to embed the YouTube trailer for each individual show. So the first thing, and you're just gonna have to bear with me, because the URL is super long.

[00:05:00]
https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/${trailer}. And then, ?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0. That's it.
>> Brian Holt: frameBorder="0". allowFullScreen, and then I think this is a new one. I think iframe is required. In fact, it says here, requires a title. Again, which is for accessibility purposes. So you have to say title={`Trailer for ${title}`}. This is so a screen reader, if they tab into it, it's gonna identify the iframe by what the contents is inside of it.

[00:06:26]
And it's gonna do that by the title.
>> Brian Holt: If you haven't looked at your site with a screen reader, you should definitely do that.
>> Brian Holt: Okay,
>> Brian Holt: So now, hopefully, we can come back to our page. And we're going to go to details, and then just one of the valid IMDB IDs.

[00:06:56]
You should be able to go in there, and you should be able to see a nice looking details page, right? It's got the title, it's got the year, it's got the poster up there, the little description.
>> Brian Holt: So it'll look something more like that. And then you can actually click it, and play the video, and all that kinda stuff.

[00:07:17]
So
