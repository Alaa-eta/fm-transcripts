00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:03.726
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Congratulations,
all of you that survived Flow, React, and

2
00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:05.655
Redux over the past couple of days.

3
00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.322
Really excited to be back here,

4
00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:10.550
and we're gonna be chatting about,
more about Redux today.

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.410
It's more advanced use cases,
like server side rendering,

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.270
code splitting, and we're even gonna
be talking a little bit about Preact.

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.169
So cool, hopefully you were able
to pull down the latest branch.

8
00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.550
Latest branch is gonna be v3-21 and
that's currently available on GitHub.

9
00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:37.354
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So kinda to recap where we
were, and I guess before we get started,

10
00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:40.169
does anyone have any questions
that they want to ask?

11
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:49.994
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There was
a question before we broke

12
00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:55.160
last night about the MobX versus Redux.

13
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.681
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, which was a great
question, so there's a library called

14
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:05.559
MobX, and inevitably, when talking about
Redux, MobX usually gets brought up.

15
00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:08.731
It fulfills the same use case as Redux and

16
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:14.680
it's a centralized state repository for
your entire application.

17
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.180
You would use MobX in the same
situations that you would use Redux.

18
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.935
Similar to how like,
you wouldn't use Redux and MobX together,

19
00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:24.706
just like you wouldn't use Ember and
Angular together, right.

20
00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.520
Same sort of idea here.

21
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.770
MobX is a really cool piece of
technology that relies on some

22
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.530
more new types of technologies and
it's really fun to play with.

23
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.580
It's very powerful,
you can achieve some pretty cool patterns.

24
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.819
They rely heavily on things
called computer properties,

25
00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.160
which end up being really cool.

26
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.480
But again, I kinda prefer my technologies
to be as simple as possible,

27
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.296
which is why I do enjoy Redux.

28
00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:59.150
It's pretty, again, you just have this
reducer cycle and that's really it.

29
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.660
So for me personally, while I've toyed
around with MobX and had a great time.

30
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.360
I haven't had a situation where I needed
that much power for my repository, or

31
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.850
my state repository.

32
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.301
So that's why I choose to
not use it typically, but

33
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.201
that's purely a personal call on my part.

34
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:21.010
You're welcome to disagree and
use it on your own as well.

35
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.790
And that's a totally valid choice.
