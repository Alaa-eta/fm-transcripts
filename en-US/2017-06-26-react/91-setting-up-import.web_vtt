00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I'm gonna need you
to go back to your Babel RC real quick.

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.601
We have react-hot-loader/babel, and

3
00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:12.861
then underneath that we're going to have
to add two more plug-ins right here.

4
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:22.803
One of them is going to be
babel-plugin-dynamic-import-webpack.

5
00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:30.387
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What this is gonna
do is it's just going to allow

6
00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:32.131
webpack to understand.

7
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.166
No, that's the second one, so this is
the second one, the first one is this one.

8
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:49.744
Babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import,

9
00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:54.790
yep, that's it.

10
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.940
So the first one,

11
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.710
this one right here, just lets babel
understand the import syntax, right?

12
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.460
Without this, it just throws in errors,

13
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.500
like I'm seeing import somewhere
I don't expect it, right?

14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.340
The second thing is actually going
to translate it to something that

15
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.140
webpack understands, which,
if you wanna know, is require.ensure.

16
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.209
It's gonna translate our import
statements to require.ensure because

17
00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:23.277
webpack already understands and
knows what to do with require.ensure,

18
00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:25.742
but that's the old way of doing it.

19
00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:29.312
We're gonna do with the brand new way
of doing it, which is import functions.

20
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.762
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is a pretty
new way of doing imports, but

21
00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:35.724
this is actually the standards
way of doing it.

22
00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:41.083
I think it's stage three,
if I remember it correctly,

23
00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:48.847
and I know the latest version of Chrome
has already implemented dynamic import.

24
00:01:48.847 --> 00:01:53.440
I think it might behind a flag,
but it's there, so that's cool.
