00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Lets go start
making some cool stuff in search.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.547
Search.jsx, while this is
a mighty fine component,

3
00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:10.248
we will be expanding this a little

4
00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:19.837
bit.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

5
00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:22.986
we're going to import our preload data, so

6
00:00:22.986 --> 00:00:26.570
we are going to say import
preload from ./data.

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.496
All right, if you remember
that's via that data.json file.

8
00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.766
If you need a refresher of what it
looks like, this is what it looks like.

9
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:38.499
It's just a bunch if
metadata about TV shows.

10
00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.951
Okay, and then we're going to create a div

11
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:50.686
className =,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Search.

12
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.642
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And,

13
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, if you want to,

14
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.948
something that's kind of useful
sometimes to do is you can use a pre and

15
00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:13.980
code to view JSON output.

16
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.120
This is just a debugging
trick that I've used a bunch.

17
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.969
And honestly, stole from Ryan Florence,
the creator of React Router, and

18
00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.565
he also does a Frontend Masters course.

19
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So all this is going
to do is it's going to preformat and

20
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.920
print out whatever is in preload.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

21
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.040
if we refresh here, I partialed that down.

22
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.820
Can't resolve ./data.

23
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.267
It's gonna be ../data.

24
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks like the eslint

25
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.090
is going to require that
we put .json on there, so

26
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.128
put .json.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now,

27
00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:16.462
hopefully, if you go refresh here,
you can see this is what our data looks

28
00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:21.613
like.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

29
00:02:21.613 --> 00:02:24.747
that trick that I showed you with
the JSON stringfy and pre and

30
00:02:24.747 --> 00:02:28.622
code, that's really useful if you're
not sure what props are coming in or

31
00:02:28.622 --> 00:02:30.672
how your state's changing overtime.

32
00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:33.312
It's just a really useful way to dump
a bunch of data to the DOM really quick.

33
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.024
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so now that we have

34
00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:45.140
that, let's go and do.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's actually go and

35
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.999
print out all of our shows.

36
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.630
So first thing we're gonna do, is we're
gonna wanna print out the title for

37
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.940
every show individually.

38
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.260
You wanna make it into an h3.

39
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.920
What we have is we have
an array of show data, right?

40
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.750
And we want to transform that into
an array of show components of some sort.

41
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.290
So for those of you that have any
functional programming background,

42
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.180
some bells should be going off in your
head, of what you should do here, right?

43
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.010
For transforming one array from array of
one thing to an array of another thing,

44
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.050
that's a map, right?

45
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.040
That's an all day map.

46
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.183
So that's what we're gonna be using here.

47
00:03:19.183 --> 00:03:22.860
And this is actually one of my
favorite points about React.

48
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.610
Is most of React is just JavaScript.

49
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.553
Now it seems kind of obvious to say that
out loud, but I mean that in the regard

50
00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:32.720
of, I want to pick on Angular
just cuz that's the one I know.

51
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.540
And I'm talking about old Angular,
Angular 1 and before.

52
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.680
There's a lot of domain specific
language in Angular, right?

53
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.350
You had to know how to do an ng4, and

54
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.310
those were very specifically
Angular skills.

55
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.830
And then once you moved on from Angular,
those skills no longer applied, right?

56
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.190
You can't use ng4 with Ember,
it doesn't make any sense.

57
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.890
What I like about React is, for
the most part, it's just JavaScript.

58
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.052
There's very little domain
specific language for React.

59
00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:07.310
There's some,
I'm not denying that there isn't some.

60
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.470
Now I need to put className in there,
it's annoying, right?

61
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.770
It's a very React-specific thing to do.

62
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.460
But I'm getting on to say that
we're gonna be using array map here

63
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.390
to do what ng4 does in Angular and
what pound each does in Ember, right?

64
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.959
So let's take a look at what
that actually looks like.

65
00:04:29.377 --> 00:04:31.413
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going to do

66
00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:36.885
preload.shows.map.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then

67
00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:39.880
we're going to say show.

68
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And for now,

69
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.240
we're just going to return an h3.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: With

70
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.917
show.title.

71
00:05:04.884 --> 00:05:09.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So prettier it took it
away, but what I had here was this.

72
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.240
So this, right here, in the map.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

73
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.960
is just a normal arrow function, right?

74
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.570
We're taking a show, which we're.

75
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.400
Well, let's go back and
talk about map for just a moment, right?

76
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.350
So preload.shows is an array, right?

77
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.210
We're gonna take that array and
we're gonna call map on it.

78
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.920
And what that does is it's going
to call this function right here,

79
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.030
once on every element.

80
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.040
Whatever this function returns, it's going
to be returned in a new array, right?

81
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.110
So, we're going to take this array,
which is an array of objects, and

82
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.268
we're going to transform it into
an array of React components.

83
00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:58.210
Cool, are we cool so far with that idea?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now if you remember,

84
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.830
what I referenced very briefly earlier,

85
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.300
React knows what to do with
array of elements, right?

86
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.180
So if we give it an array of elements,
it knows how to render those.

87
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.174
So that's precisely what we're doing,

88
00:06:11.174 --> 00:06:14.690
is we're giving it an array of elements,
okay?

89
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.158
So that's what's going on here.

90
00:06:21.158 --> 00:06:24.957
Now, particularly with arrow functions,

91
00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:29.474
if you have exactly one parameter,
no more no less,

92
00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:34.210
the parenthesis around
the parameters are optional.

93
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.120
So, as soon as I save this,
it's going to take away these parenthesis.

94
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.850
That's where they're going.

95
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.275
It's prettier that takes them away.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

96
00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:49.934
so now, if I come back here, you'll notice
that I have a bunch of h3s on the page.

97
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.409
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

98
00:07:06.238 --> 00:07:08.669
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Is it best practice to pull

99
00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:16.184
out the preload.shows into another JSX
variable and then put it inside the div?

100
00:07:16.184 --> 00:07:22.494
Or is it still, I don't know,
would you consider doing the map function

101
00:07:22.494 --> 00:07:26.940
inside the div to be best practice?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean,

102
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.900
it definitely depends
on what you're doing.

103
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.160
I mean, another beautiful point about
React is it's not really super specific

104
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.740
about what it wants you to break
into components and what not.

105
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.620
I found, when I was first writing React,
I had a tendency to break things down into

106
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.040
just tiny, tiny, tiny components to the
point that it was no longer useful, right?

107
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.020
Because things were made up
of too many components and

108
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.820
just didn't really make a lot of sense.

109
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.580
So now I try and
break them down into atomic objects.

110
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.940
In fact, that's what, you kind of you're
beating me to my punch here, jerk.

111
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.200
No, I'm just kidding.

112
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.610
Then we're gonna build
a component in here.

113
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.600
And then I'm gonna comment to
you that this is too big and

114
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.060
we should break it into two components.

115
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.646
So let's go make it too big first and
then we'll break it into two components.

116
00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:16.570
But for now this is a tiny component,
if this was all this was doing.

117
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.450
Yeah, this is great.

118
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.600
Let's just leave it that way, right?

119
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.240
There's no hard and fast rules,
if there's a map then you must do this.

120
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.870
I don't know,
someone make that rule I don't.

121
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.450
I just trying to do what's sane, right?

122
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.520
I find those dogmatic rules typically
don't serve you in the long-run.
