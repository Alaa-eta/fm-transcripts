00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.724
&gt;&gt; Brian: It's kind of verbose to have
to repeat writing createElement over and

2
00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:06.700
over and over again.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.890
There's a couple ways to do this.

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.145
So first of all,

5
00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:14.906
a bunch of people that write React
don't even know what createElements is.

6
00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:17.398
The reason being is that
they never have to write it,

7
00:00:17.398 --> 00:00:20.244
cuz we're gonna get to writing JSX,
in maybe like an hour.

8
00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:27.333
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, so they don't
every have to write createElement,

9
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.900
JSX transpiles to createElement calls.

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.110
But I do know some crazy people
who have chosen not to write JSX,

11
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.256
and it is possible to write huge
apps without using any JSX.

12
00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:42.240
So I'm gonna show you just a couple tricks
of how to do that a little bit easier.

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.831
So you can say const ce
= React.createElement,

14
00:00:48.578 --> 00:00:51.811
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then now I can replace all

15
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:57.471
these createElements,
I'm just gonna do find,

16
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:03.013
React.createElement, replace that with ce.

17
00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:07.273
And we'll just say replace all, and
we've got to do that again, createElement.

18
00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:16.740
&gt;&gt; Brian: And it gets a little bit easier
to, or it's a little less dense, right?

19
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.400
You don't need all those
React.createElements every single time.

20
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.180
There's also a package called
createFactory that helps as well.

21
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.350
And there's also react-dom helpers, which
I'm not going to show you how to do today,

22
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.520
because it's kind of
the old way of doing it.

23
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.612
And once we get to JSX,
that's not helpful anyway.

24
00:01:37.612 --> 00:01:40.974
But you can do things like div and
h1, right, so

25
00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:44.760
you can actually call them
by the name of the function.

26
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.356
Then you get rid of this, oops.

27
00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:50.320
&gt;&gt; Brian: What happened there?

28
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.330
Right, and
it looks something like that, right?

29
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.814
Again, getting less and less dense,
but you have to get some helper

30
00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:59.635
libraries to do that, and
we're not gonna do that today.

31
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.520
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

32
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:10.499
&gt;&gt; Brian: So now that we've done that,
let's go ahead and talk about props and

33
00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.350
attributes.

34
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.410
So, so far not super useful, right?

35
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.490
Cuz we're just rendering out My
second component a bunch of times,

36
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.619
not entirely exciting.

37
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.600
So let's go make this a little
bit more interesting.

38
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.740
We can actually pass properties
from MyFirstComponent into MyTitle.

39
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.762
So let's try doing that real quick.

40
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:40.708
&gt;&gt; Brian: So we're gonna pass,
call it the title.

41
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.310
&gt;&gt; Brian: And we're gonna put some
of our favorite tv shows in here.

42
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.714
So let's put Game of Thrones,
that's a good one, Stranger Things.

43
00:02:57.732 --> 00:02:59.252
&gt;&gt; Brian: What's a good TV show?

44
00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:01.221
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Rick and Morty.

45
00:03:01.221 --> 00:03:02.450
&gt;&gt; Brian: Rick and Morty,
that's a good one.

46
00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:09.075
&gt;&gt; Brian: And Silicon Valley.

47
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.617
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

48
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.236
&gt;&gt; Brian: So now inside of MyTitle,

49
00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:22.260
the first thing that's going to be
passed into it is a thing called props.

50
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.510
And props is just going to be
whatever you passed in right here.

51
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.994
So instead of saying My component
right here, I can see props.title.

52
00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:43.783
&gt;&gt; Brian: So now if we save this,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And come back over here,

53
00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:48.758
notice that now we have multiple different
kinds of titles, which is pretty cool.

54
00:03:52.868 --> 00:03:55.600
&gt;&gt; Brian: So we're getting more
reuseable right, more flexible.

55
00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.170
We can pass different properties into
components and kind of mold them.

56
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.900
Right now we're just changing the text,
but we can do all sorts of things, right?

57
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.270
Sometimes I could be like,
show this particular theme for

58
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.910
this widget, or I don't know.

59
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.655
If a user's logged in, show this,
if a user's logged out, show that.

60
00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:22.679
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just to clarify, props is
just like a syntax that most people use,

61
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:26.550
or do people call the-
&gt;&gt; Brian: Would you call this anything

62
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.670
other than props?

63
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.070
Never, you would never call
it anything other than props.

64
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.760
I've never seen it called
anything other than props.

65
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.350
So it is convention,
you could call it something else, don't.

66
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.707
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But don't.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

67
00:04:40.558 --> 00:04:42.301
&gt;&gt; Brian: So let's take this even a step

68
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:46.915
further, and we want to change the color
of whatever's being passed in here.

69
00:04:49.406 --> 00:04:53.966
&gt;&gt; Brian: So we're gonna pass
something else into all of these.

70
00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:03.254
&gt;&gt; Brian: So one of my favorite interview
questions to ask people is always,

71
00:05:03.254 --> 00:05:05.520
what's your favorite CSS named color?

72
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.770
I have a couple of new ones.

73
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.900
So there is YellowGreen,
which is my favorite.

74
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.633
My second favorite is GreenYellow.

75
00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:22.799
And LimeGreen, and then just Lime,
which are also different colors.

76
00:05:28.654 --> 00:05:35.189
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
actually still my favorite is peru.

77
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:41.373
[LAUGH] You really just can't beat peru,
which is a color.

78
00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:42.569
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I know
PapayaWhip's pretty cool.

79
00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.558
&gt;&gt; Brian: PapayaWhip is pretty good,
what else?

80
00:05:46.558 --> 00:05:50.395
I don't know, medium aquamarine,
that's a really good one.

81
00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:55.905
&gt;&gt; Brian: So what we're going to do here
is we're going to pass that color to be

82
00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:57.610
the color of the h1, right?

83
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.610
So instead of being null here,
we're gonna pass it an object.

84
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.360
And we're gonna give it a style attribute.

85
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.324
It's not a typical style string
that you'd put into the,

86
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.640
&gt;&gt; Brian: Onto the actual DOM, right?

87
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.070
It's actually gonna be an object,
which is a little bit easier to work with.

88
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.373
So we're gonna do color, and
that's gonna be props.color.

89
00:06:28.573 --> 00:06:30.881
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right, and
as long as this is called the same thing,

90
00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:32.710
it could be anything, right?

91
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.722
So if I change this to be, I don't know,

92
00:06:36.722 --> 00:06:40.975
the Canadian way or British way, or both.

93
00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:48.088
&gt;&gt; Brian: But anyway, so now if we
save that and come back over here,

94
00:06:48.088 --> 00:06:52.760
you'll notice that we have
various shades of green and peru.

95
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.166
If you did not know,
that is the color of peru.

96
00:07:01.908 --> 00:07:03.853
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, any questions so far?

97
00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:10.728
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So for the style, you could
pass a string, but that's just cumbersome,

98
00:07:10.728 --> 00:07:11.986
that's why we wanna do that?

99
00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:13.332
&gt;&gt; Brian: I don't think it actually works.

100
00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:14.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

101
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.280
really what's happening
underneath the hood is,

102
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.360
this is actually interacting with
the JavaScript API for DOM elements.

103
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.937
And this is the way you actually
interact with the style API,

104
00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:34.964
with just the DOM API
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

105
00:07:39.437 --> 00:07:39.995
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Another question.

106
00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:42.370
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.

107
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do any authors
ever avoid using props and

108
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.040
instead pass individual
arguments to the constructor for

109
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.397
a little bit better self
documenting components, or?

110
00:07:55.397 --> 00:07:59.890
Cuz MyTitle could accept a color and
a title as arguments, and

111
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.660
that would be a little bit more obvious
than just property bag coming in.

112
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.670
&gt;&gt; Brian: The answer to that question
is no, you do have to do it this way.

113
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.430
Because React is actually
hooking into those and

114
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.280
it'll known when to re-render
based on what you passed into it.

115
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.600
Now you can get around that, which
I'll show you later today, with Flow.

116
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.010
Cuz then Flow will start warning you.

117
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.230
So typing your React components
actually helps a ton.

118
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.140
There's also something called prop types,
which again,

119
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.850
we will also talk about those.

120
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.102
And Flow is gonna be
a static type checker, so

121
00:08:32.102 --> 00:08:34.250
it's gonna tell you that at compile time.

122
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.480
Whereas prop types is gonna tell you at
run time, it's like hey, this was missing.

123
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.803
So it is a problem, but
there's tooling to get around it.

124
00:08:41.803 --> 00:08:42.600
That's a good question.

125
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Terry is asking,
what about attributes?

126
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.569
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like what kind of attributes?

127
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.186
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think it's the same thing,
props and attributes are synonymous.

128
00:08:56.186 --> 00:08:59.470
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah and in this particular
case for React, we call them props,

129
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.690
but they are attributes as well.

130
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, attributes in HTML.

131
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.104
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, yeah.

132
00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:15.730
&gt;&gt; Brian: So this is really it for
React at it's most basic level, right?

133
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.040
Just passing props down to the components.

134
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.610
We're going to get here
to state momentarily.

135
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One other question.

136
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.511
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just for

137
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:28.309
a little bit further clarification
on that second argument,

138
00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:31.021
which is null, those are HTML attributes?

139
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.730
&gt;&gt; Brian: So for this particular one,
right, for the h1s and the divs, this is

140
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.820
actually going to be the attributes that
are gonna be put onto the DOM, right?

141
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.407
But for something like MyTitle, this isn't
actually something that gets rendered

142
00:09:44.407 --> 00:09:47.580
directly to the DOM,
there's not a MyTitle tag, right?

143
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.474
So this is what's passed into
the component here as props.

144
00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:57.437
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so
is id, MyFirstComponent,

145
00:09:57.437 --> 00:10:05.550
is id recognized as a special property
that gets tagged on to HTML or?

146
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.271
&gt;&gt; Brian: React naively passes
that just to the DOM right?

147
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.619
&gt;&gt; Brian: So for example,
if this was React Native,

148
00:10:13.619 --> 00:10:16.883
it would be a totally different
set of attributes, right?

149
00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:17.620
Does that make sense?

150
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.960
Cool, so again, if you have something
like Flow, Flow will check that for

151
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.810
you to make sure it's like, hey, you tried
to pass idd, and that's not a thing.

152
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.909
So that's a failure, right?

153
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.470
But we're not using
anything like that yet.

154
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:40.619
So don't mess it up, that's the big
key here just to not mess up anything.

155
00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:43.768
Good question, other questions?

156
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:46.846
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.

157
00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:49.595
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just about the color,
the name of colors.

158
00:10:49.595 --> 00:10:50.890
&gt;&gt; Brian: Mm-hm.

159
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that just the coming
from, where is that coming from?

160
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.260
&gt;&gt; Brian: These particular colors?

161
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian: These are all-

162
00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Native colors?

163
00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.239
&gt;&gt; Brian: Native colors, right?

164
00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:02.512
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So I could totally call this.

165
00:11:02.512 --> 00:11:03.296
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.

166
00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:07.262
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right, and
that would totally work.

167
00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:15.275
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

168
00:11:18.964 --> 00:11:23.619
&gt;&gt; Brian: So this is it for
writing React without JSX.

169
00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:26.110
[COUGH] We're gonna start getting
a little bit more complicated.

170
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.360
And so we're gonna start adopting some
tooling to kinda help us along here.
