WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Should we add a link on
the show card to go to the detail page?

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.170
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.
How did I miss that?

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.887
Okay, let's do that real quick.

4
00:00:09.887 --> 00:00:12.148
Show card.

5
00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:12.810
I totally forgot this.

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.360
We are supposed to bring in a link here.

7
00:00:15.878 --> 00:00:19.339
Import, yeah cuz you want to be
able to get to the show card or

8
00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.636
the details page from the search page.

9
00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.785
&gt;&gt; Brian: From 'react-router-dom'.

10
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:36.556
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'.

11
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.160
&gt;&gt; Brian: And let's see here.

12
00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:47.710
&gt;&gt; Brian: Make sure I get this right.

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.418
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

14
00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:52.830
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's how I missed it.

15
00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:58.450
&gt;&gt; Brian: So what we're gonna do here,

16
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.094
is we're going to wrap
the wrapper in a Link to.

17
00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:10.326
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
this is gonna be a template tag /details/.

18
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.571
&gt;&gt; Brian: Props.imdbID.

19
00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:24.435
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, how did I miss that?

20
00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:25.279
Okay.

21
00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:33.695
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Need to close those carets.

22
00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:34.498
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yep.

23
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:41.170
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now it's gonna complain
about this imdbID not being there.

24
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.325
Something that we can refactor this to be.

25
00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:50.753
So rather than this being props: and then
listing out every single thing possible,

26
00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:55.196
we can just say this is a show,
cuz we defined that show type already.

27
00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:55.965
And save that.

28
00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:04.120
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool, and now we have
this all being wrapped in a Link.

29
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.720
So if we go back over here.

30
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.416
Go back.

31
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:14.050
&gt;&gt; Brian: Wow,
that doesn't look like it's supposed to.

32
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.836
It's abstract.

33
00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:34.618
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's okay, sorry.

34
00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:36.319
Not quite.

35
00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.376
&gt;&gt; Brian: We're gonna actually
change Link to be Wrapper.

36
00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:46.271
&gt;&gt; Brian: And remove Link here.

37
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:51.040
&gt;&gt; Brian: I've misread my notes.

38
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.730
So we're gonna have Wrapper which is
eventually gonna be the link tag.

39
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.264
So rather than having this
being Wrapper = styled.div,

40
00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:04.415
what we can actually do is we can
have styled component's wrap Link.

41
00:03:08.757 --> 00:03:10.898
&gt;&gt; Brian: This is gonna
yell at us because.

42
00:03:14.213 --> 00:03:16.710
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah,
we'll talk about that in a second.

43
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.850
But you will be getting a flow
type error momentarily here.

44
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.290
So now if we save that.

45
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.348
&gt;&gt; Brian: Getting closer.

46
00:03:30.412 --> 00:03:33.817
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, now we have to add
just two more lines of CSS here.

47
00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:38.223
I'm gonna say color: black; to keep
that color for that link text.

48
00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:42.310
And there also gonna have
text-decoration: none.

49
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.080
And then save that,
come back over here and

50
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.850
now everything looks how
its suppose to begin.

51
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.061
And also, now you can click on things and
go to their detailed pages.

52
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.133
&gt;&gt; Brian: And looks like the breaking
bad one got pulled down.

53
00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.630
&gt;&gt; Brian: But you can go on it and
you can click into each one of them.

54
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.420
Okay, any questions about that?

55
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you scroll down to the.

56
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.387
&gt;&gt; Brian: I just took the Link out of it.

57
00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:18.000
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then I put wrapper 2, right?

58
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.397
Because that's the property that's
gonna be passed down into Link.

59
00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.172
&gt;&gt; Brian: I'll talk about the flow
error here in just a second.

60
00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.671
&gt;&gt; Brian: Any other questions about that?

61
00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:41.375
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

62
00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:52.898
&gt;&gt; Brian: So I just perpetually have
issues with styles, components and flow.

63
00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:54.918
So there's a couple of
ways you can solve this.

64
00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.612
&gt;&gt; Brian: One of them is
you can just say Link: any.

65
00:05:00.612 --> 00:05:01.650
I think that would work.

66
00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.290
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
this is a good way of doing it.

67
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.410
This is just like,
when the library is typing, so

68
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.720
not exactly how they should be, I'm
totally fine just throwing it out here and

69
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.890
say you know what, don't check this part.

70
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.940
I know this is fine,
I know react-router-dom

71
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.340
is giving me something that's valid react,
so cool, just call that in any.

72
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.670
This is called a casting.

73
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.800
So typically you don't have to worry
about typecasting in JavaScript.

74
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.000
It's all coerced for you.

75
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.560
But this particular case,we're just
gonna say, this Link isn't anything.

76
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.520
I don't think you can actually
identify this as a react component.

77
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.180
I think it's still gonna yell about that.

78
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.360
It's gonna say, I don't know what that is.

79
00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:03.497
And then.

80
00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:12.548
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, itâ€™s not gonna like that,
so maybe just don't.

81
00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:17.794
&gt;&gt; Brian: Nope, so
we're just gonna stick with any.

82
00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:23.250
&gt;&gt; Brian: Someday they'll fix this and
you can come back and not typecast it.

83
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.130
But again this is just saying,
for this particular instance,

84
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.160
assume Link is an any type which
is then going to say cool,

85
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.610
then I'm not going to check this
particular typing right here.

86
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.060
The other one you can do which I showed
you earlier is just FlowFixMe, and

87
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.910
it's just going to ignore the next line.

88
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.870
Either one of those is fine.

89
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.200
I'm gonna still with the any for now,
but you're welcome to do it either way.

90
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How do you maintain
navigation state throughout the app?

91
00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.872
&gt;&gt; Brian: The best answer to that question
I think, where possible you wanna stick it

92
00:07:02.872 --> 00:07:07.716
in the URL, so you have deep links to
hold the different states of your app.

93
00:07:07.716 --> 00:07:11.657
So one thing that we're not doing here
that you definitely could do, is when

94
00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:15.907
you're typing black right here, you could
have installed that in the URL state so

95
00:07:15.907 --> 00:07:19.293
that someone could copy that link and
share with their friend, or

96
00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:21.716
they could bookmark it
all that kind of stuff.

97
00:07:21.716 --> 00:07:23.916
It's all very possible
to do with React router,

98
00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:26.664
I do not remember how to do it
at the top of my head, but it's.

99
00:07:28.195 --> 00:07:31.953
&gt;&gt; Brian: You would just interact
with the history object and say,

100
00:07:31.953 --> 00:07:37.195
push this state onto the app or replace
this state, depending on if you wanted to

101
00:07:37.195 --> 00:07:43.087
add a new entry for every [COUGH] B-L-A,
and then B-L-A-C, and then B-L-A-C-K.

102
00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:45.351
You've probably want to do what's
called replace state there, so

103
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:47.351
that we're just be replacing
the state every single time.

104
00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:53.759
&gt;&gt; Brian: So yeah, navigation
should typically live in the URL,

105
00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:58.000
which means you're be interacting
with router to do that.

106
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.120
If you don't wanna do that, then you
just need to find a common ancestor.

107
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.010
Our common ancestor would be app and
keeping it in there.

108
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.600
Yeah we don't have any real navigation
state beside the search term so.

109
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But this person was saying
what order do lifecycle methods execute,

110
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.995
when you have nested components?

111
00:08:22.015 --> 00:08:25.150
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like what happens first,
the children or the parents components.

112
00:08:26.392 --> 00:08:29.896
&gt;&gt; Brian: The real answer to that
question is that you don't have to care.

113
00:08:29.896 --> 00:08:34.850
[LAUGH] You can think of each component
more or less as an island, cuz they

114
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.060
shouldn't really be interacting with each
other in terms of their lifecycle methods.

115
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.470
That's kind of a dodgy answer, and

116
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.820
it's also something that's changing
because right now we're on

117
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.100
an architecture of react called Stack,
the Stack Architecture.

118
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.270
This is as a 15.5 in previous.

119
00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.070
With React 16 we're moving to something
called the Fiber Architecture,

120
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.500
which is going to change totally the way
that it's a complete rewrite of react.

121
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.607
However it's totally API compatible.

122
00:09:06.607 --> 00:09:09.490
So there shouldn't be any
break it from 15.5 to 16.

123
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.040
They should just migrate
the architecture and nothing changes.

124
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.060
And with that, they're gonna do all
sorts of different ways of when and

125
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.580
how components are rendering.

126
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.563
And so this is kind of a way of me saying
that it doesn't really matter, and

127
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.148
I also don't know because
it doesn't matter.
