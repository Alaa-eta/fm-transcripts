WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.237
&gt;&gt; Brian: So yeah,
I just wanted to emphasize, especially for

2
00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:05.916
future video watchers,
that this is version three.

3
00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:10.678
So make sure that you are on the correct
course website because there are three

4
00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:11.714
versions of it.

5
00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:17.613
I just wanted to you right here that
there are versions one, two, and three.

6
00:00:17.613 --> 00:00:21.487
With the version three, there's not
really a good reason to watch version two

7
00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:24.670
anymore, but there is still a good
reason to watch version one.

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.931
Version one is gonna use createClass,

9
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.023
which we're not gonna use
createClass at all today.

10
00:00:30.023 --> 00:00:33.375
And if this doesn't make sense to you,
it's okay cuz it's deprecated.

11
00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:37.432
It uses Mocha, Chai, Sinon for testing.

12
00:00:37.432 --> 00:00:41.763
So if you wanna see how react testing
looks with those particular frameworks,

13
00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:43.930
that's a good reason to look at it.

14
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.553
Version one, version two used
what's called standard ESLint.

15
00:00:47.553 --> 00:00:50.343
And today, we're going to be using Airbnb.

16
00:00:50.343 --> 00:00:52.425
And then, there's just a bunch
of other stuff down here.

17
00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:55.370
You can look at that at your leisure.

18
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.763
So there are links to version one and
version two on here.

19
00:00:57.763 --> 00:00:59.900
But again, today,
we're gonna be on version three.

20
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.520
You can always be assured that the one
that's at this particular URL, which

21
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.160
is also easy to get to at, thinho.lt/react
will always be the most up to date one.

22
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.374
And then, I'll move the other
ones to different links.

23
00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:23.376
&gt;&gt; Brian: I'm really excited that
Frontend Master gives me the time and

24
00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:27.580
[COUGH] resources to be able to go and
develop this course.

25
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.080
All of this material will
live online free forever.

26
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.510
And yeah, you can watch the videos on
Frontend Masters, which is pretty sweet.

27
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.880
So a little more introduction about me.

28
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.900
My name's Brian Holt,
currently living in San Francisco, but

29
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.390
originally from Salt Lake City.

30
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.070
Just really, really happy to be here.

31
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.620
Previously worked at Netflix and Reddit.

32
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.478
Currently doing the unemployed thing,
which is pretty fun.

33
00:01:53.478 --> 00:01:54.560
I'm really enjoying that.

34
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.950
And yeah,
this is the complete intro to React.

35
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.400
So let's talk about the structure of how
this particular workshop is gonna work.

36
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.593
A lot of times when you
get into React tutorials,

37
00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:11.414
they just kinda throw you straight
into the deep end, right?

38
00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:14.700
It's like out of the box, you have
to set up webpack, and then Babel,

39
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.290
and testing frameworks, and just all these
different tools right out of the box.

40
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.910
And a common refrain amongst
new developers with React is

41
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.010
it's too complicated.

42
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.140
There's too much going on.

43
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.830
There's too much magic,
and I don't really get it,

44
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.960
which is really frustrating to me because
it doesn't have to be that way, right?

45
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.090
React itself, at least the way
that you interact with React,

46
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.070
is actually really simple.

47
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.480
And then, we built all this complexity
on top of it to make it easier, right?

48
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.932
Some of these two terms here,
simple and easy, which I'm borrowing

49
00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:50.114
from a talk called Simple Made Easy, which
I definitely suggest that you go watch.

50
00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:54.172
But to kind of define those terms for you,
something can be easy and complex and

51
00:02:54.172 --> 00:02:57.320
something can be simple and hard, right?

52
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.930
So easy just means that it's
really easy to get done, but

53
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.120
it can be very complicated.

54
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.160
And simple means that it's the thing
itself is actually fairly simple.

55
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.140
Or in other words, not complex, but

56
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.340
it can be really hard to wrap
your mind around, right?

57
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.890
So my best example, that's Redux, right?

58
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.110
A lot people find Redux to be very
simple cuz there's not much to it, but

59
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.033
it's pretty hard.

60
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:20.180
It's a pretty hard library
to get your mind around.

61
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.040
So anyway, what I wanna say is that
we're gonna start with bare-bones React,

62
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.462
with literally nothing else.

63
00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:29.908
We're gonna not even like
include a separate script file.

64
00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:33.070
We're going to put it straight
into the HTML to show you

65
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.560
that it really is a pretty simple library.

66
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.902
And then, as we are gonna keep going,

67
00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:42.440
we're gonna keep introducing new
tools to make our lives easier.

68
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.830
But in that process of introducing tools,

69
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.360
we make our application more complex,
right?

70
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.510
So basically, what I'm trying to say is,
I'm gonna try and

71
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.370
justify the complexity
of the tooling to you.

72
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.163
And along the way, hopefully,

73
00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:58.893
you'll be able to understand
the tools that we're using as well.

74
00:03:58.893 --> 00:04:04.304
So yeah, with Reacts, typically,
you're not using just Reacts, right?

75
00:04:04.304 --> 00:04:08.769
You can, and I'm not saying React by
itself can build complicated apps,

76
00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.093
and there's no reason to
even introduce a build step.

77
00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:13.276
So it can be done.

78
00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:19.320
However, it's gonna make your life
easier if you do have these tools.

79
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.250
So by showing you these tools,
I'm justifying the complexity.

80
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.696
I'm hoping that you'll see why they're
there and embrace the complexity for

81
00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:27.713
the sake of ease.

82
00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:30.085
&gt;&gt; Brian: Furthermore,

83
00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:33.490
you don't have to use any of these
tools that we're using today.

84
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.560
For example, we're gonna be
using Flow later in the day,

85
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.240
maybe tomorrow, probably?

86
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.700
Probably tomorrow, but you can use
TypeScript, that's totally okay.

87
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.260
These are all just choices.

88
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.460
I've made a bunch of choices for you and

89
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.490
hopefully that you can see where to pull
out these tools and put your own in.

90
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.680
React is a kind of choose
your own adventure, right?

91
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.258
It's not necessarily, this is
the one way to do everything, right?

92
00:04:56.258 --> 00:04:58.530
It's not self-prescriptive like Meteor.

93
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.980
Meteor is amazing, but
you don't get many choices with Meteor.

94
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.660
You get some, but not very many.

95
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.160
With React,

96
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.340
it's kind of an open field for you to kind
of put the different pieces together.

97
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.030
But that means you get stuck putting
all the pieces together, as well.

98
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.680
So, cool.

99
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.310
So yes, you're gonna be able
to plug your own pieces in.

100
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.390
And I'll be sure along the way
to highlight different

101
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.030
alternatives that you
could definitely use.

102
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.840
So today, we'll be using things like Node,
webpack, Jest,

103
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.552
Enzyme, Yarn, Prettier,
ESLint, and React-Router, Flow.

104
00:05:33.552 --> 00:05:37.000
We're gonna use the Airbnb config for
ESLint.

105
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.890
These are all the different kind
of technologies we're gonna use.

106
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.390
If you don't already have
Node installed at this point,

107
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.220
please make sure that you get that
done sooner rather than later.

108
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.450
As long as you're above four, I don't
think we're gonna be using anything that's

109
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.949
more complicated than that.

110
00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.806
You really could get by on 0.12.

111
00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:57.601
I do not recommend it though.

112
00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:00.823
[LAUGH] I will be on 7.10.

113
00:06:00.823 --> 00:06:04.732
And actually, I saw that today,
eight is getting released.

114
00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:10.457
We will not be using eight, [LAUGH] cool.

115
00:06:10.457 --> 00:06:13.742
There's a ton of spelling errors and
stuff like this on the repost.

116
00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:18.710
So if you see them, feel free to
file an issue, open a poll request,

117
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.640
you know, angry Tweets.

118
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.239
All these things work at getting at me,
so...cool.

119
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.330
So, let's go ahead and get started.

120
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.290
So the first thing is I'm gonna need you
to go clone the start branch, which I have

121
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.980
a nice little link there for you,
which I'm going to do with you as well.

122
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.190
Along the way I'm willing to be
pushing up branches to this repo.

123
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.280
In fact, you can see here,
there's a lot of branches.

124
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.136
I'll be prefixing everything with V3,
but today we're gonna go ahead and

125
00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:55.323
start with Start.

126
00:06:57.602 --> 00:06:59.830
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, I'm not gonna be
talking too much how to use Git today.

127
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.910
There's plenty of tutorials for
that online.

128
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.540
But I will show you how to go ahead and
clone the.

129
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.060
So I'm gonna just come here, I'm going to
grab this URL and go to my command line.

130
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.355
And I'm gonna say git clone That.

131
00:07:20.446 --> 00:07:22.260
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
I need to get the start bench too.

132
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.665
So I'm gonna say git fetch origin start.

133
00:07:27.978 --> 00:07:29.463
&gt;&gt; Brian: I have to go
into the repo first.

134
00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:35.680
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and
I'm gonna git checkout start.

135
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.930
So just to make sure.

136
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.610
Yep, and I am now on the V3 stark branch.

137
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.230
Okay, so it should look
a little something like this.

138
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.670
Just to kind of give you
a bit of a tour around,

139
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:58.260
you're going to have an editorconfig file
This is only if you use editorconfig,

140
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.040
which is a nice plug in for
almost every different editor,

141
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.530
it's just going to set all of your editor
preferences automatically for you for

142
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.070
that particular project.

143
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.040
So in this particular case it's gonna make
sure they have two spaces for indents,

144
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.030
it's gonna be using spaces not tabs,
all these different things.

145
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:21.530
So gitignore, just a bunch of stuff that
we should ignore open this in sublime.

146
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.800
I'm gonna be using sublime for today
because that's what I know hoe to use.

147
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:33.570
I have no host in this particular battle
of which editor to use, I just don't care.

148
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.180
[LAUGH]
Actually, I hadn't been using cloud today.

149
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.460
I was arguing, well, arguing,

150
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.570
yeah, arguing with someone
about semicolons this morning.

151
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.080
And I have spent more characters typing
out arguing about semicolons than I have

152
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.240
saved from not writing semicolons.

153
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.500
Which I found quite ironic.

154
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.320
So, okay, let's look at what we have here.

155
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.840
So, we have a data, that JSON file.

156
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.180
Which is going to be a bunch
of TV shows kind of data.

157
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.940
This is what we're gonna be building today
is kind of a video viewing sort of app.

158
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.770
So this just has a bunch of like titles,
descriptions, that sort of thing.

159
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.360
That's went to data.json.

160
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.620
In my package.json file I have
locked down these dependencies for

161
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.840
you, the reason being that, typically you
don't want to lock down dependencies like

162
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.760
I have here, but if someone tries
this workshop in like a year, right,

163
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.610
if they don't get the same dependencies,
everything is going to break.

164
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.220
I can't tell you how many times I get
tweeted like, hey this is broken, and

165
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.670
that's because they try newer versions
of one of these particular Libraries.

166
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.310
So, anyways, needless to say,
these are all our dependencies.

167
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.000
Which is crazy, right, when you look at
how many dependencies we're bringing in

168
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.110
here, which hopefully makes
sense during the day.

169
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.590
Then we have this ratings api.js.

170
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:02.270
So previously this used the open movie
database to pull different meta data for

171
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:07.560
these movie or tv shows down,
unfortunately that

172
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.900
API went private so
I kind of wrote here just like a quick and

173
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.070
dirty little API server that you can run
for yourself so this will always work.

174
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.260
So that's all this does,
it's just a tiny little express server.

175
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.810
And I'll show you how to run it later.

176
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.110
And then lastly, there's a lock file.

177
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.730
This is a lock file to
lockdown all the dependencies.

178
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.620
So cool.

179
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.960
So that's everything
that should be included.

180
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.230
And there's some CSS and
images and whatnot.

181
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.420
So we'll be using those as well.

182
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.330
Okay, so going back here.

183
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.940
This is literally the notes that I have,

184
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.500
that I'm going to be reading from
while I teach you this workshop.

185
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.820
So if you fall behind or if you wanna
see something a different way or

186
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.430
see what I'm reading here,
it's all available here.

187
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.540
And that's actually what I
have on this laptop here.

188
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.260
So
