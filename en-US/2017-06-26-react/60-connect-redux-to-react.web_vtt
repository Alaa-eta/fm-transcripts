00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; Brian: So now, basically everything
is completed on the Redux side, but

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.720
now we need to go in and make the UI
actually dispatch out to Redux, okay?

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.388
So I want you to go to hap.jsx just real

4
00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:19.957
quick.
&gt;&gt; Brian: The first thing

5
00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:25.870
that we need to do is we need to
basically make Redux available to React.

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.892
So we're gonna import { Provider

7
00:00:30.892 --> 00:00:39.053
} from 'react-redux'.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

8
00:00:39.053 --> 00:00:44.109
react-redux is a package that all it
does is it's just thin little bindings

9
00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.770
between React and Redux that make it
easier to write Redux with React.

10
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.560
It's by no means a hard requirement
that you use react-redux, you definitely

11
00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.100
do not have to, but let me rephrase
that you're gonna want to, for sure.

12
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.910
It just does a lot of the glue layer
stuff that's really un-fun to do, and

13
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.650
they do a good job at it.

14
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.140
So inside of BrowserRouter,
we're just gonna put Provider and

15
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.769
then again right there Provider.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So yep, that's what I thought.

16
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.380
Flow is gonna yell at you.

17
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.502
And this is another advantage
to using Flow here.

18
00:01:28.502 --> 00:01:32.680
It's gonna say, hey,
I'm expecting something called store, and

19
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.060
you did not give it to me.

20
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.190
So, I just forgot momentarily that
you also have to provide it a store.

21
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.620
So, let's go ahead and do that real quick.

22
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.318
So, we're just gonna go import store from

23
00:01:45.318 --> 00:01:52.260
'./store'.
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then

24
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.138
here you're just gonna say store={store}.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

25
00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:00.780
this is another reason that I like Flow.

26
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
I love that my tools remind me to do stuff
like this cuz I totally would have forgot

27
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.661
and moved on right now.
&gt;&gt; Brian: But

28
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.950
that all happens because we have
React Redux typings from flow

29
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.763
typed.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Something

30
00:02:20.763 --> 00:02:24.886
that people will point out to me is that,
you could totally, it makes no

31
00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:29.530
difference if provider's on the outside or
browser writer's on the outside.

32
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.609
It will work either way.

33
00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.569
I intentionally chose it
this way because we're gonna

34
00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.710
do server-side rendering tomorrow.

35
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.630
And that makes it a lot easier
if it's organized this way, but

36
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.220
if you weren't doing server-side
rendering it wouldn't make a difference.

37
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.530
Again, this is what's called
a higher order component.

38
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.550
It itself displays nothing but it just
does some stuff for you that it puts,

39
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.590
its gonna put Redux on context, which is
what we were talking about previously.

40
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.560
So that we can refer to it in
other places inside of our app, so

41
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.850
that is whats happening there.
