1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: CSS selectors and
the Cascade, so

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.300
now we're gonna talk about the C part.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.720
We're gonna answer our friend's question,
which one wins?

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.130
Which is always a good question.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.425
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The Cascade,

6
00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:21.050
this is always just the part that
I get least excited to talk about.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.160
Okay, the Cascade is gonna cause you so
many problems.

8
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.960
It's gonna take years
of your life [LAUGH].

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.317
It's really cool,
you can see why they created it, but

10
00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:40.080
I've worked in companies to see it
used and abused so many terrible ways.

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.709
That's why I get a little stressed
out whenever I say the word Cascade.

12
00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:51.278
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's

13
00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:53.590
say I have two paragraphs.

14
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.620
I must have broken this some way or
other, but pretend this one's red and

15
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.670
pretend this one's green, and
I wanna make them style different ways.

16
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.560
As you might imagine, I might use
classes to differentiate the two.

17
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.110
It's what we talked about previously.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.198
So I would say this one would be like,
I don't know, error text, and

19
00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:15.160
this would be success text, or
something to that effect, right?

20
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.988
Some semantic good naming thereof.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

21
00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:22.959
we did that with the section on classes,
and

22
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.450
making sure that we have labelled
them well and things like that.

23
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.050
We do thing here like this
one will be called branding,

24
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.360
and this one will be called post add-on.

25
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.870
This one have one set of styling, and
this would be another set of styling.

26
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.340
This is what I'm saying here.

27
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.390
We're going to using the style tag here,
this is not typically how you would do it.

28
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.980
You would typically have a separate CSS
file and a separate HTML file, but for

29
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.580
instruction purposes we're
just doing it all in one file.

30
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.130
Cool?

31
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.390
The other thing I will tell you is that
this style will bleed outside of this,

32
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.630
just so you know.

33
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.650
So like, if I say like,

34
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.484
all h1s on the page should be orange,

35
00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:12.880
this will affect the entire page.

36
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.850
Just be aware that, if you start
seeing things that look really weird,

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.252
it's probably because you put
something in the somewhere.

38
00:02:22.252 --> 00:02:26.520
Okay, so if I have an h1 here called
branding and an h1 here called blog post

39
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.500
title, and I want this one to be red and
this one to be green.

40
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.030
Select branding, and this one,
I select blog-post-title.

41
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.410
The way that you differentiate that
I'm asking for a class and not for

42
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.390
a tag is you put this period here.

43
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.844
This period before the selector means

44
00:02:46.844 --> 00:02:51.026
class.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah,

45
00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:54.880
just make sure you remember
that the period means class.

46
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.870
If I wanna select the class called
branding, I do .branding, or

47
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.970
if I wanna do blog post title,
it's .blog-post-title.

48
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.680
If I delete this dot,
it's gonna mess this up.

49
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.580
It's gonna be looking literally for
a tag called branding,

50
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.950
which is not a real tag, but

51
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.486
that's what it's going to be looking for.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does it make sense?

52
00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:23.540
So .branding,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

53
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.570
that's what you look for.

54
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.793
You look for the dot.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Generally speaking,

55
00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:34.071
should you style on tags or classes?

56
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:37.446
Always style in text,
blog always style on.

57
00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:41.538
We just cut that part out
[LAUGH] always style on classes.

58
00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:45.660
Don't style on text, hardly ever.

59
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.474
I would not suggest it.

60
00:03:47.474 --> 00:03:52.381
The only time that I would suggest
styling on tags is if you literally

61
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:56.590
mean everything in this
document should look like this.

62
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.199
And a good example of that was,
if I'm doing a website like this one,

63
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.394
this Intro to Web Dev.

64
00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:05.610
If I go look at this,
you'll notice that all of my anchor tags,

65
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.873
all of my links,
look the same .That makes sense

66
00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:12.610
because now I want all anchor
tags to look like that.

67
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.430
That would make sense for

68
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.390
me to style via tag, but I only wanna do
that if I literally need every single one.

69
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.559
That makes sense?

70
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.180
I would say that like I'm mostly
giving you my opinion on these things.

71
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.260
There might be people who disagree with
me, but they would be wrong, first of all.

72
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.720
I don't think it's actually
that controversial.

73
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.120
I think most people would tell
you a relatively similar thing.

74
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.270
So, style by class, that's just kind
of a thing you want to get used to.

75
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.260
Mostly you should be styling by classes.

76
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.310
You will have a lot of heartache that you
will accidentally be styling things using

77
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.970
tags that you can avoid if
you always style by classes.

78
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.122
It's just a better idea.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Bare

79
00:05:04.122 --> 00:05:07.490
on the side of using classes too much.

80
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.282
If you're not sure one way or the other,

81
00:05:09.282 --> 00:05:13.058
just go with classes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It might mean like a tiny

82
00:05:13.058 --> 00:05:16.230
bit of extra writing, but doing a tiny
bit of extra writing will save you a lot

83
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.717
of heartache in the long run.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

84
00:05:20.717 --> 00:05:25.850
any questions about that so far?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

85
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you show us how you

86
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.930
would, I see that you're
styling by class there, can

87
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.780
you show us how you would style by tag?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, you

88
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.070
would just put h1, instead.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: With

89
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.455
a dot?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

90
00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:46.455
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not gonna work for

91
00:05:46.455 --> 00:05:50.480
other reasons, which we'll get to
literally in the next section.

92
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.022
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, I was asking

93
00:05:51.022 --> 00:05:51.970
[INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You wanted to know why it

94
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.970
wouldn't work?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, it wasn't working with

95
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.960
mine, so I was wondering.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, there are reasons,

96
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.710
which we'll talk about, but good question.

97
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.410
Let's refresh this page
with git brought something.

98
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.120
Okay, that's an astute observation.

99
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.481
So, you can see here I
was sitting on the beach

100
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:20.027
in Sydney actually when I
was writing this section.

101
00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:24.625
I was like wish I could stop here,
I can't [LAUGH].

102
00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:29.204
So, this is the part where CSS, this to
me is what we've done so is pretty fun.

103
00:06:29.204 --> 00:06:33.540
I think you just like make a rule and
see change, and it's kinda fun.

104
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.270
There's a thing called the Cascade
that has bitten in the ass so

105
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.500
many times that it just It's not done, so

106
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.500
I'm going to invite you to avoid using
the Cascade as much as possible.

107
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.840
Like, keep your CSS as simple as possible
and avoid making it more and more complex.

108
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.750
And I'll give you some like war stories
and horror stories towards the end when

109
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.320
you understand a little bit
more what I'm talking about.

110
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.650
So the Cascade, someone asked before,

111
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.800
what happens basically if I have
two conflicting tags, right?

112
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.890
If I have two things that
are both saying the same thing,

113
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.350
one of them has to win, right?

114
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.450
If I say, this one says green and
this one says orange, and

115
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.920
they both match, which one wins?

116
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.940
Cuz there can only be, well,
you know it's either gonna be green or

117
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.550
it's gonna be orange.

118
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.600
It's not gonna be both and
it's not gonna mix them.

119
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.360
That would be way worse, so
you can be grateful it doesn't do that.

120
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.958
I should write a library that does that,
that sounds terrible.

121
00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:37.550
Okay, terrible ideas.

122
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.330
So if I have dot title here,
dot title here.

123
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.100
I think I've probably like
ruined the surprise so

124
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.680
far, because I scrolled down far enough.

125
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.470
Which one wins and why?

126
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.280
Because these both
are the same thing right?

127
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.230
There's nothing preventing me from
putting dot.title on there twice.

128
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.690
Obviously green came out on top, but why?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It came

129
00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.820
last.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It came last.

130
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.910
That's exactly the reason.

131
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.290
These two are exactly the same.

132
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.200
So when two things are considered
equal in terms of CSS,

133
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.560
the one that comes last wins.

134
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.960
Even if I had title and other-title,
I'm not very creative right

135
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.598
now.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It still is selecting

136
00:08:22.598 --> 00:08:27.580
by one class, and it doesn't matter
that they're different in any respect.

137
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.398
They're both one class, so
therefore the one that comes last wins.

138
00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:36.120
Good so far?

139
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.810
So when everything is considered equal,
the one that comes further down, wins.

140
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.540
Cool, so when you have two rules
with the same class, it's legal.

141
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.470
I would not suggest it.

142
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.450
I can't see of any reason why you would
want to separate those things out,

143
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.870
but you can.

144
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.205
It's legal, just don't.

145
00:08:56.205 --> 00:08:58.980
[LAUGH]
Which one gets applied?

146
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.980
It's the one that's on the bottom,
it'd be same

147
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.860
if we had two different
H one selectors as well.

148
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.210
So if this said H one and

149
00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.250
this one said H one, it would also be
the one that came lower that would win.

150
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.470
Okay, yeah.

151
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.740
So what I wanted to point out here is, so
yes these are two different classes here.

152
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.740
So title two and main brand two,
but notice one thing.

153
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.710
So I have main brand here two,
which is losing on red, right?

154
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.910
Because this one comes down, so
this ends up being green, but

155
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.910
this one does not specify border, right?

156
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.990
It does get a black border because
it's a result on a property

157
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.500
by property basis, so
this is one pixel solve.

158
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.200
Notice here that it does
en up having black border.

159
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:56.200
I can even actually,
if I say border, style, dotted.

160
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.956
Notice it has,- let's go
with dashed to see a little

161
00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:04.850
better.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

162
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.005
I see up here 1 pixel solid black and
I change it to here so

163
00:10:08.005 --> 00:10:11.110
just the dashed part's being changed,
right.

164
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:15.120
So it's even more granularly resolved.

165
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.930
Does that makes sense?

166
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:24.290
So I'm just overriding the border style,
this is called the cascade.

167
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.900
Just so you know, it's going through this
cascading effect of trying to resolve

168
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.690
the properties to kinda get down
to one resolution of style.

169
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.170
So we're dancing around this
thing that is called, and

170
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.660
again I hate this word specificity.

171
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:49.900
[LAUGH]
Like go around to a like

172
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.630
a hardened friend and developer and ask
them what they think about specificity.

173
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.310
And you'll just see like they'll just get
this like long glance, it's like a ten

174
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.700
thousand foot glance and is like
the stories I could tell you, right?

175
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.420
Like it's just like I've been to war or
something.

176
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.140
AnYou just end up with these like,
I'm showing you here a very,

177
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.300
very simple cases, but
imagine this 14 layers deep and

178
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.530
trying to figure out where
the health of this style come from.

179
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.280
That's why I'm telling you to keep
everything really, really simple because

180
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.840
the simpler you keep it the less prompts
that you're gonna have about this.

181
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.110
Like I have some bad examples
underneath here so you can see why.

182
00:11:34.628 --> 00:11:38.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's keep going here.

183
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:45.806
We did that
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,

184
00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:48.000
we're going to get into multiple classes.

185
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.960
So, I have title three here, right.

186
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.270
So, this has title three and
main brand three.

187
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:59.470
But, now up here I have main brand
3.title-3, and which colour wins?

188
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.060
Red.

189
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.360
Because it is more specific.

190
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.150
It has two classes,
this only has one class.

191
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.300
This one is therefore more specific and
therefore wins.

192
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.410
This is the specificity part of this.

193
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.920
Now notice there is no space here.

194
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.210
Between three and dot tittle.

195
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.030
Right?

196
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.080
It's right there.

197
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.130
It's shot together.

198
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.470
If I put a space there, I break it.

199
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.240
So, he said it needs to be shot together
and they're separated by a period.

200
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:38.080
Cuz it's the main brand and
it's also the title classes.

201
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.390
Both of those classes which it has.

202
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.860
So, there's no space between them.

203
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.240
Therefore it wins because
it has two classes.

204
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:55.100
Now keep in mine that this h1 down here
has to match both of those classes.

205
00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.930
It must have title-3 and
it must have main-brand-3.

206
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.200
Just to show you.

207
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.850
If this just has title-3

208
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.660
Notice it's green because it
doesn't match the entire selector.

209
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.920
So it must match everything
in this selector.

210
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.314
Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yes.

211
00:13:19.314 --> 00:13:21.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

212
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.130
Next steps here.

213
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.734
Each one comeslower on the page And

214
00:13:25.734 --> 00:13:30.583
title-4.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice which one it

215
00:13:30.583 --> 00:13:34.720
went here, orange.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why?

216
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.530
Because classes are more
specific than tags.

217
00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:46.039
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why?

218
00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:47.010
I don't know.

219
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:47.890
Why do we do anything?

220
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.219
It just is.

221
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:57.440
So let me give you a little device to
see if this helps you kind of determine.

222
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.120
You can kind of think of
it as being like a number

223
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.470
where the first number is how
specific the tag part is,

224
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.500
the second number is how
specific the class part is so.

225
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.640
I think I have it done here.

226
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.140
Yeah.

227
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.200
So this has one class so it's 10 specific.

228
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.270
And this has one tag so
it's one specific, right.

229
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:27.570
Whereas if I had like 3 classes,
it be like 30, right.

230
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.720
So you can think of this tens place as
being how many classes there are And

231
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.640
the ones place of being
how many tags there are.

232
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:40.030
So if I had 3 classes, that's 30,
compared to like 5 tags,

233
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.720
which is impossible but
ignore that for a second.

234
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.290
The 30 would be bigger than the 5,
so therefore the classes would win.

235
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.790
Doesn't totally work out.

236
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:54.180
If I had 11 Tags one class
would still be more specific.

237
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.290
So it's just kind of a mental
device that's kind of imperfect but

238
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.210
just think of class as being
more specific than text.

239
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:06.477
That's all totally what I'm
trying to get out here.

240
00:15:06.477 --> 00:15:07.733
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, let's move on and

241
00:15:07.733 --> 00:15:09.859
just get this even more complicated.

242
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.110
So I have title-5 main-brand-5.

243
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.626
It's an h1.

244
00:15:15.626 --> 00:15:23.270
h1.main-brand-5 .main-brand-5.title-5 and
.main-brand.

245
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.560
So this one is one tag and one class.

246
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.770
Two tags and one tab,
sorry Two classes in one class.

247
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.640
So thinking about it, this is one tag.

248
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.120
This is like eleven, right?

249
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.302
This is like twenty.

250
00:15:44.302 --> 00:15:44.950
This is like one.

251
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.830
No sorry, this is like ten.

252
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.150
So therefore the one that is twenty wins,
right?

253
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.310
So the one with two classes, so
therefore it becomes orange.

254
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.960
Does that make sense?

255
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.205
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is how you do tags and

256
00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:06.530
classes together, right?

257
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.338
This is an h1, right,
has no period in front of it, and

258
00:16:10.338 --> 00:16:12.780
then .main-brand-5, right?

259
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:18.020
So that's how you get the Tag and
class selector together.

260
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.600
I to not do this.

261
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.090
This is usually not a good idea to
do the tags and classes together.

262
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.930
The reason being is like it
should usually just be enough for

263
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.730
you to have just main-brand-5
like that should be it.

264
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.520
And you shouldn't Really be mixing tags
in classes like if something is made for

265
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.160
H1s it should always be on H1s.

266
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.440
So you don't want normally want to
select H1s differently than H2s.

267
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:51.139
Like it wouldn't make a ton of sense for
me to do have like an H2 main brand five.

268
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:53.925
That's really strange and

269
00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:57.249
it's gonna be hard to follow when you're
trying to write this code later so

270
00:16:57.249 --> 00:17:01.679
I would stay away from that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again,

271
00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:05.310
just in general avoid styling by tag,
it's just not a good idea.
