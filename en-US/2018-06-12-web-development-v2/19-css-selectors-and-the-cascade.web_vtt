00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: CSS Selectors and the
Cascade, so now, we're gonna talk about

2
00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:08.621
the C part, we're gonna answer our
friend's question, which one wins?

3
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:10.933
Which is always a good question.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.669
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the cascade,
this is always just the part that I

5
00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.884
get least excited to talk about.

6
00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:24.950
Okay, the cascade is gonna cause you so
many problems,

7
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.727
it's gonna take years off your life.

8
00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:32.533
[LAUGH] It's really cool,
you can see why they created it, but

9
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:37.341
I've worked at enough companies
to see it used and abused in so

10
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:39.941
many terrible, terrible ways.

11
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:43.325
That's why I get a little stressed
out whenever I say the word cascade.

12
00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:53.533
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's say,
I have two paragraphs.

13
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:57.295
I must have broken this somewhere,
but pretend this one's red and

14
00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.477
pretend this one's green, and
I wanna make them styled different ways.

15
00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:05.308
As you might imagine, I might use
classes to differentiate the two,

16
00:01:05.308 --> 00:01:07.232
what we talked about previously.

17
00:01:07.232 --> 00:01:12.240
So I would say this one would be like,
I don't know, error text and

18
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.713
this one would be success text or
something to that effect,

19
00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:19.858
some semantic, good naming, thereof.

20
00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:22.974
So we did that with
the section on classes,

21
00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:27.313
making sure that we labeled them well and
things like that.

22
00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:31.344
We single them here like this
one would be branding and

23
00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:34.132
this one would be called post title.

24
00:01:34.132 --> 00:01:39.241
And this one have one set of styling and
this would be another set of styling.

25
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.051
This is what I'm saying here,
we're gonna be using the style tag here.

26
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:44.292
This is not typically how you would do it,

27
00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:48.540
you would typically have a separate
CSS file and a separate HTML file.

28
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.553
But for instruction purposes we're
just doing it all in one file, cool?

29
00:01:54.553 --> 00:01:58.824
The other thing I will to tell you is that
this style will bleed outside of this

30
00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:00.630
[LAUGH] just so you know.

31
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.380
So if I say all h1s on the page should be.

32
00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:14.539
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Orange,
this will affect the entire page.

33
00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:18.396
So just be aware that if you start
seeing things that look really weird,

34
00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:22.531
it's probably because you put something
in a code block somewhere, okay.

35
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:27.868
So if I have an H1 here called branding,
and an H1 here called blog post title,

36
00:02:27.868 --> 00:02:31.292
and I want this one to be red and
this one to be green,

37
00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:36.094
this one I select branding and
this one I select, blog-post-title.

38
00:02:36.094 --> 00:02:40.213
The way that you differentiate that
I'm asking for a class and not for

39
00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:42.211
a tag is you put this period here.

40
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:47.911
This period before
the selector means class.

41
00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:54.518
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah, just make sure you
remember that, the period means class.

42
00:02:54.518 --> 00:02:59.662
So if I want to select the class
called branding, I do dot branding or

43
00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:04.732
if I want to do blog-post-title,
it's .blog-post-title.

44
00:03:04.732 --> 00:03:07.622
If I delete this dot,
it's gonna mess this up,

45
00:03:07.622 --> 00:03:11.238
it's gonna be looking literally for
tag called branding,

46
00:03:11.238 --> 00:03:15.592
which is not a real tag, but
that's what it's going to be looking for.

47
00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:17.663
Does that make sense?

48
00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.650
So .branding.

49
00:03:23.532 --> 00:03:25.476
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's what you
look for, you look for the dot.

50
00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:34.133
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Generally speaking,
should you style on tags or classes?

51
00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:37.732
Always style in tags.

52
00:03:37.732 --> 00:03:39.480
Can we just cut that part out?

53
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.541
Always style in classes.

54
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:45.406
Don't style on tags, hardly ever.

55
00:03:45.406 --> 00:03:47.634
I would not suggest it.

56
00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:52.622
The only time I would suggest styling
on Tags is if you literally mean

57
00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:56.485
everything in this document
should look like this.

58
00:03:56.485 --> 00:04:00.095
And a good example of that was if
I'm doing a website like this one,

59
00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:01.328
this Intro to Web Dev.

60
00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:06.063
And if I go look at this,
you'll notice that all of my anchor tags,

61
00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:09.542
all of my links look the same,
that makes sense.

62
00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:12.610
Because now,
I want all anchor tags to look like that.

63
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.332
That would make sense for
me to style by a tag.

64
00:04:15.332 --> 00:04:19.681
But I only want to do that,
if I literally mean every single one.

65
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:22.208
That make sense?

66
00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:25.868
I would say, I've giving most
of my opinion on these things.

67
00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:30.986
There might be people that disagree with
me but they would be wrong, first of all.

68
00:04:30.986 --> 00:04:33.789
And second, I don't think it's
actually that controversial.

69
00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.409
I think most people would tell
you a relatively similar thing.

70
00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:44.452
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So style by class, that's
just kind of thing that you want to get

71
00:04:44.452 --> 00:04:47.404
used to,
mostly you should be styling by classes.

72
00:04:50.452 --> 00:04:53.896
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You will have a lot of
heartache that you'll accidently be

73
00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:58.690
styling things, using tags that you just
can avoid if you always style by class.

74
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.509
It's just a better idea.

75
00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.076
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: On the side
of using classes too much.

76
00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:12.293
If you're not sure one way or
the other just go with classes.

77
00:05:12.293 --> 00:05:17.281
It might mean a tiny bit extra writing,
but doing a tiny bit of extra writing

78
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:20.463
will save you a lot of
heartache in the long run.

79
00:05:20.463 --> 00:05:22.140
Cool, any questions about that so far?

80
00:05:25.364 --> 00:05:25.914
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

81
00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:28.255
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you
show us how you would,

82
00:05:28.255 --> 00:05:31.633
I see that you're styling by class there.

83
00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:36.295
Can you show us how you
would style by tag?

84
00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:38.852
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
if you would just put H1 instead.

85
00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:39.441
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: With a dot?

86
00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:45.142
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

87
00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:48.042
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not gonna work for
other reasons.

88
00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:48.755
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

89
00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:50.385
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which we will get
to literally the next section.

90
00:05:50.385 --> 00:05:52.208
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, I was just asking-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You want to know why

91
00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:52.760
it won't work?

92
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
it wasn't working with mine so.

93
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.932
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, there are reasons,
which we will talk about.

94
00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:00.753
But good question.

95
00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:09.642
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's refresh this page,
I think, I broke something, okay.

96
00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:13.370
That's an astute observation.

97
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.229
So, [LAUGH], you can see here.

98
00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.282
I was sitting on the beach in Sydney
actually when I was writing this section.

99
00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:23.057
I was like,
I wish I could stop here, I can't.

100
00:06:23.057 --> 00:06:30.082
[LAUGH] So this is the part where CSS, to
me what we've done so far is pretty fun.

101
00:06:30.082 --> 00:06:33.540
You just make a rule and
see change and it's kind of fun.

102
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.656
There's a thing called the cascade
that has bitten me in the ass so

103
00:06:39.656 --> 00:06:41.475
many times that it just.

104
00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:43.093
That's high five.

105
00:06:43.093 --> 00:06:49.331
So I'm going to invite you to avoid
using the cascade as much as possible.

106
00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:56.091
Like keeping CSS as simple as possible,
and avoid making it more and more complex.

107
00:06:56.091 --> 00:07:00.300
And I'll give you some like war stories
and horror stories towards the end when

108
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.330
you understand a little bit more what
I'm talking about, so the cascade.

109
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.523
Someone asked before,

110
00:07:05.523 --> 00:07:08.800
what happens basically if I have
two conflicting tags, right.

111
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.667
If I have two things that
are both saying the same thing,

112
00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:13.133
one of them has to win right.

113
00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:17.149
If I say, this one says green and
this one says orange and

114
00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.727
they both match, which one lives.

115
00:07:19.727 --> 00:07:23.413
Cuz there can only be It's either going
to be green or it's going to be orange.

116
00:07:23.413 --> 00:07:24.554
It's not gonna be both.

117
00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:25.707
It's not gonna mix them.

118
00:07:25.707 --> 00:07:27.102
That would be way worse.

119
00:07:27.102 --> 00:07:30.222
[LAUGH] So
you can be grateful it doesn't do that.

120
00:07:30.222 --> 00:07:31.512
I should write a library that does that.

121
00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:34.036
That sounds terrible.

122
00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:37.372
Okay, terrible ideas.

123
00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:42.212
So if I have dot title here,
dot title here I think I probably ruined

124
00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:46.461
the surprise so far,
because I scrolled down far enough.

125
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:48.410
Which one wins and why?

126
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.062
Cuz these both are the same thing, right?

127
00:07:50.062 --> 00:07:54.052
There's nothing preventing me from
putting .title on there twice.

128
00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:58.184
Obviously, green came out on top, but why?

129
00:07:58.184 --> 00:07:59.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because it came last.

130
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.133
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It came last,
that's exactly the reason.

131
00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:04.562
If these two are exactly the same.

132
00:08:04.562 --> 00:08:09.104
So when two things are considered
equal in terms of CSS,

133
00:08:09.104 --> 00:08:11.531
the one that comes last wins.

134
00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:16.170
Even if I had title and other title.

135
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.803
I'm not very creative right now.

136
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.749
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It still is
selecting by one class and

137
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:27.362
it doesn't matter that they're
different in any respect.

138
00:08:27.362 --> 00:08:33.679
They're both one class so
therefore the one that comes last wins.

139
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.903
Good so far?

140
00:08:35.903 --> 00:08:40.753
So when everything's considered equal
the one that comes further down Wins.

141
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:49.323
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so when you have two
rules with the same class, it's legal.

142
00:08:49.323 --> 00:08:50.292
I would not suggest it.

143
00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:53.951
I can't see of any reason why you would
want to separate those things out,

144
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:54.610
but you can.

145
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.180
It's legal, just don't.

146
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.722
[LAUGH] Which one gets applied?

147
00:08:58.722 --> 00:08:59.960
It's the one that's on the bottom.

148
00:09:03.221 --> 00:09:05.821
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It'd be the same if we
had two different h1 selectors as well.

149
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:09.051
So if this said h1 and this one said h1,

150
00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:14.001
it would also be the one that
came lower that would win, okay?

151
00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:20.357
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so what I
wanted to point out here is, so yes,

152
00:09:20.357 --> 00:09:24.812
these are two different classes here,
so title-2 and main-brand-2.

153
00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:30.492
But notice one thing, so I have main-brand
here, too, which is losing on red, right?

154
00:09:30.492 --> 00:09:33.562
Because this one comes down,
so this ends up being green.

155
00:09:33.562 --> 00:09:37.602
But this one does not specify border,
right?

156
00:09:37.602 --> 00:09:45.612
So it does get a black border because its
result on a property by property basis.

157
00:09:45.612 --> 00:09:47.815
So this is one pixel, saw it black,

158
00:09:47.815 --> 00:09:51.126
notice here that it does end
up having a black border.

159
00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:56.460
If I say border-style,
dotted, notice that it has a,

160
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:02.265
let´s go with dashed, so
you can see it a little bit better.

161
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.992
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I say up here,
1px solid black and I changed it here.

162
00:10:07.992 --> 00:10:11.110
So just the dashed part is being changed,
right?

163
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:15.959
So it's even more granularly resolved.

164
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:16.930
Does that make sense?

165
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.940
So I'm just overriding the border style.

166
00:10:22.553 --> 00:10:24.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is called
the cascade just so you know.

167
00:10:24.902 --> 00:10:28.550
It's going through this
cascading effect of trying to

168
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.241
resolve the properties to kind of
get down to one resolution of style.

169
00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.901
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're dancing
around this thing that is called.

170
00:10:40.901 --> 00:10:43.537
And again, I hate this word, specificity.

171
00:10:43.537 --> 00:10:49.044
[LAUGH] Go around to a hardened
front end developer and

172
00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:53.812
ask them what they think
about specificity.

173
00:10:53.812 --> 00:10:58.130
And they'll get this long glance,
this 10,000 foot glance, and

174
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.765
it's like all the stories
I could tell you.

175
00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:03.574
It's like they've been to war or
something.

176
00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:08.464
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You just end
up with these rat´s nests.

177
00:11:08.464 --> 00:11:14.103
I´m showing you here very, very simple
cases, but imagine this 14 layers deep.

178
00:11:14.103 --> 00:11:17.352
And you´re trying to figure out where
the hell did this style come from?

179
00:11:17.352 --> 00:11:22.680
That's why I'm telling you to keep
everything really, really simple because

180
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.939
the simpler you keep it, the less problems
that you're gonna have with this.

181
00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:32.822
I have some bad examples underneath here,
so you can see why.

182
00:11:34.764 --> 00:11:40.767
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's keep going here, we did that.

183
00:11:45.602 --> 00:11:49.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
we're going to get into multiple classes.

184
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.863
So I have title-3 here, right?

185
00:11:50.863 --> 00:11:53.272
So this has title-3 and main-brand-3.

186
00:11:53.272 --> 00:11:58.034
Now, up here I have main-brand-3.title-3.

187
00:11:58.034 --> 00:12:00.502
And which color wins?

188
00:12:00.502 --> 00:12:06.440
Red because it is more specific.

189
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.051
It has two classes,
this only has one class.

190
00:12:10.051 --> 00:12:15.062
This one is therefore,
more specific and therefore, wins.

191
00:12:15.062 --> 00:12:17.410
This is a specificity part of this.

192
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.859
Now, notice there is no space
here between 3 and .title, right?

193
00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:25.116
It's right there shoved together.

194
00:12:25.116 --> 00:12:27.428
If I put a space there, I break it.

195
00:12:27.428 --> 00:12:32.544
So they need to be shoved together and
they're separated by a period.

196
00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:37.509
Cuz it's the main brand and
it's also the title classes,

197
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:40.556
both of those classes which it has.

198
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.828
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
there's no space between them, therefore,

199
00:12:46.828 --> 00:12:50.273
it wins because it has two classes.

200
00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:54.883
Now, keep in mind that this h1 down
here has to match both of those classes.

201
00:12:54.883 --> 00:12:59.690
It must have title-3 and
it must have, I mean, brand-3.

202
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:08.012
Just to show you, if it just has title-3,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice,

203
00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:10.441
it's green because it doesn't
match the entire selector.

204
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:13.966
So it must match everything
in the selector.

205
00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:16.785
That make sense, okay?

206
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:29.052
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next steps here,
h1 comes lower on the page and title four.

207
00:13:29.052 --> 00:13:34.500
Notice which one wins here, orange, why?

208
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.827
Because classes are more
specific than tags.

209
00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:46.144
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why?

210
00:13:46.144 --> 00:13:46.790
I don't know.

211
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.737
Why do we do anything?

212
00:13:47.737 --> 00:13:51.371
[LAUGH] It just is.

213
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:57.222
So let me give you a little device
to see if this helps you determine.

214
00:13:57.222 --> 00:14:02.183
You can think of it as being a number
where the first number is how

215
00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:04.253
specific the tag part is.

216
00:14:04.253 --> 00:14:08.971
The second number is how
specific the class part is.

217
00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:12.382
So I think, I have it down here.

218
00:14:12.382 --> 00:14:17.209
Yeah, so this has one class,
so it's ten specific,

219
00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:22.050
and this has one tag, so
it's one specific, right?

220
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:27.390
Whereas, if it had three classes,
it'd be 30, right?

221
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.980
So you can think of this tens place as
being how many classes there are and

222
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.052
the ones place of being
how many tags there are.

223
00:14:35.052 --> 00:14:39.270
So if I had three classes,
that's 30 compared to like,

224
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.503
five tags which is impossible,
ignore that for a second.

225
00:14:43.503 --> 00:14:47.064
The 30 would be bigger than the five
therefore the classes would win.

226
00:14:47.064 --> 00:14:48.571
It doesn't totally work out.

227
00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:53.962
If I had 11 tags,
one class would be still more specific.

228
00:14:53.962 --> 00:14:56.962
So it's just kind of a mental
device that's kind of imperfect.

229
00:14:56.962 --> 00:15:00.440
But just think of classes
being more specific than text,

230
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.637
that's ultimately what I'm
trying to get at here.

231
00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:07.758
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's move on and

232
00:15:07.758 --> 00:15:12.096
just get this even more complicated
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

233
00:15:12.096 --> 00:15:16.684
I have title-5 main-brand-5, it's in h1.

234
00:15:16.684 --> 00:15:23.372
Each one main-brand-5.

235
00:15:23.372 --> 00:15:26.853
So this one is one tag, and

236
00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:31.442
one class, two tags, and one, or

237
00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:36.051
sorry, two classes in one class.

238
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:39.461
So thinking about it, this is one tag.

239
00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:41.674
This is 11, right?

240
00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:44.380
This is 20 and this is one.

241
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.263
Sorry, this is ten.

242
00:15:47.263 --> 00:15:49.220
So therefore, the one that's 20, wins.

243
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.920
So the one with two
classes becomes orange.

244
00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:01.809
Does that make sense, okay?

245
00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:06.432
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is how you do tags and
classes together, right?

246
00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:13.248
This is an h1, has no period in front
of it and then a .main-brand-5, right?

247
00:16:13.248 --> 00:16:19.282
So that's how you get the tag and
class selector together.

248
00:16:19.282 --> 00:16:20.961
I'll invite you to not do this.

249
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:25.306
This is usually not a good idea,
to do tags and classes together,

250
00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:30.847
the reason being it should usually be
enough for you to have just name-brand-5.

251
00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:37.109
That should be it and you shouldn't
really be mixing tags and classes.

252
00:16:37.109 --> 00:16:40.052
If something is made for h1's,
it should always be on h1's.

253
00:16:40.052 --> 00:16:44.352
So you don't normally want to
select h1's differently than h2's.

254
00:16:44.352 --> 00:16:49.051
It wouldn't make a ton of sense for
me to do,

255
00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:52.613
to have an h2 main-brand-5.

256
00:16:52.613 --> 00:16:53.716
That's really strange, and

257
00:16:53.716 --> 00:16:56.501
it's gonna be hard to follow when
you're trying to write this code later.

258
00:16:56.501 --> 00:16:58.788
So I would stay away from that.

259
00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:03.867
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again, just in general,
avoid styling by tag,

260
00:17:03.867 --> 00:17:05.310
it's just not a good idea.
