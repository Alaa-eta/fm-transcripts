WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.048
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is
actually gonna be pretty good,

2
00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:05.595
we're gonna have enough time for
me to explain the project for you.

3
00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:10.823
And then we can break for the day and
you all can come back and

4
00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:14.354
we can work out this project together.

5
00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:19.430
So this is actually gonna be you creating

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.364
an index file with a separate CSS file.

7
00:00:24.364 --> 00:00:28.063
And creating this kind of layout.

8
00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:30.890
This is gonna be an HTML
in the CSS project.

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.242
You should have an index.html file.

10
00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.181
I would suggest creating
like its own folder.

11
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:38.243
You can put it like in your desktop or
something like that.

12
00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:42.427
And, inside of that folder having
index.html, and have a style.css,

13
00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:47.163
it doesn't actually really matter what
you call it as long as you're consistent.

14
00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:50.212
And if you ever wanted
to create this website.

15
00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:55.567
So this something that a designer would
hand you this, hey I created this in

16
00:00:55.567 --> 00:01:01.262
Photoshop or In Design or Sketch, whatever
the hipsters are using these days.

17
00:01:01.262 --> 00:01:05.941
Napkins, I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

18
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:08.541
I want it to look like this, right?

19
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:12.273
And so you would go back and
you would use HTML and

20
00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:16.481
CSS to recreate basically
something of this nature.

21
00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:23.575
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you have all the tools.

22
00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:25.571
This is a far bigger project
than I've given you before.

23
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:30.482
But I also think it's useful for you to
kind of try and struggle and Google and

24
00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:31.496
collaborate.

25
00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:32.747
Feel free to talk to each other and

26
00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:38.555
all those all those sorts of things.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

27
00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:42.562
yeah, one thing I wanted to show you.

28
00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:45.636
So if I open my Visual Studio account

29
00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:50.955
here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm

30
00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:54.438
gonna create a new file.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

31
00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:58.304
let's just say this goes on Desktop.

32
00:01:58.304 --> 00:02:02.141
I'm gonna call it FEM,
for Frontend Masters.

33
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:04.136
And, inside of here I'm gonna

34
00:02:04.136 --> 00:02:08.367
put index.html.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,

35
00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:13.210
one thing I'll show you that's really
useful specifically with code.

36
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.983
If I put HTML:5 and just hit Tab.

37
00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:22.722
It generates all of that stuff for me.

38
00:02:22.722 --> 00:02:26.132
And I can't remember that
off the top of my head.

39
00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:28.705
You can leave the meta stuff as well.

40
00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:32.432
They're basically just saying like this
is encoded in this particular way.

41
00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:37.663
This is how big I want the view port,
so just, you can leave that.

42
00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:41.326
And I don't really actually know
what this one does, I just leave it.

43
00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:45.712
[LAUGH] It's one of those things that I'm
like, yeah, just leave it, it's fine.

44
00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:51.575
We'll call this Frontend Masters.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

45
00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:55.822
we'll just put a h1 in here that says lol,
okay?

46
00:02:55.822 --> 00:02:58.361
Okay, so now I have this HTML document.

47
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:01.212
I wanna show you how to
open it in your browser.

48
00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:02.774
So I have my browser open.

49
00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:07.752
This works with Chrome, or
this works with basically any of them.

50
00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:14.373
I'm gonna hit File&gt;Open File, or
Cmd+O, that's usually what I do.

51
00:03:14.373 --> 00:03:18.939
I'm going to find it which is on
my desktop, I'm gonna go to fem,

52
00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.692
I'm gonna go to index.html and
I'm gonna say Open.

53
00:03:22.692 --> 00:03:26.812
So you open it just like you would a Word
document, but you do it with your browser.

54
00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:31.791
It's gonna be on this,
normally you go to http://, right?

55
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:35.446
With this it's gonna be file:///, right?

56
00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:38.185
What's happening here is your computer is

57
00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:41.248
acting like a server.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

58
00:03:41.248 --> 00:03:44.881
your computer is acting like a server and
serving itself.

59
00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:47.206
Your file system is basically a server.

60
00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:50.484
That's what's going on behind the server,

61
00:03:50.484 --> 00:03:55.322
literally your browser is making
requests to your same computer.

62
00:03:55.322 --> 00:03:58.143
That's how that works.

63
00:03:58.143 --> 00:04:04.111
So yeah, make sure you have this open and
then if I come in here and

64
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:08.553
change this to say omg,
like that and I save it.

65
00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:11.384
Then I come over here, and if I hit cmd+R,

66
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:14.617
it will refresh the page and
I can see my changes.

67
00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:17.553
So you can kinda do that rapid iteration.

68
00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:21.938
Same thing if you wanna
create your index.css.

69
00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:23.962
I'm gonna come in here to this.

70
00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:27.410
I'm gonna create a new
file by hitting Cmd+N.

71
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.928
I'm gonna say styles.css.

72
00:04:31.928 --> 00:04:33.829
Again, there's no reason
it has to be called

73
00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:38.541
that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm

74
00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:41.422
gonna put a new link tag in here.

75
00:04:41.422 --> 00:04:44.252
So the nice thing, again, about code is
that I don't have to remember everything.

76
00:04:44.252 --> 00:04:47.176
I can just type link and
then if I hit tab,

77
00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:51.397
it just generates a link tag for
me, which is really nice.

78
00:04:51.397 --> 00:04:52.531
This is called Emmet.

79
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:57.059
This is available in Sublime and
other things, E-M-M-E-T.

80
00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.753
I'm not going to show you how to do it.

81
00:04:57.753 --> 00:05:02.416
In fact, there is a course on it
from Mike North on Frontend Masters.

82
00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:04.940
I feel like I haven't plugged
Frontend Masters enough today.

83
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.908
So I'm gonna do it again,
check that one out.

84
00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:12.566
Anyway, so I'm gonna say ./styles.css.

85
00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:19.142
So I'm gonna save that and
I'm gonna say h1s have color red.

86
00:05:19.142 --> 00:05:22.892
Come back over here,
refresh, now it's red, okay?

87
00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:24.243
I wanted to to show you the cycle,

88
00:05:24.243 --> 00:05:27.080
cuz I don't want you be confused
by setting these things up.

89
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.082
I don't really care about that.

90
00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:30.133
I want you to you like learn the code.

91
00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:34.388
You can figure all those stuff later.

92
00:05:34.388 --> 00:05:38.195
I would suggest taking
this one road at a time.

93
00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:41.287
The first thing you should do, you should
make like the title of the top which

94
00:05:41.287 --> 00:05:43.183
is the new times or
whatever you wanna call it.

95
00:05:43.183 --> 00:05:45.610
The name of your fake news paper.

96
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.520
I want you to make a row of stores,
the one in the left and

97
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.009
the one in the right are gonna be 25% and
the one in the middle is be 50%.

98
00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.530
There is gonna be an image here in
the middle, and these are gonna be titles.

99
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.933
And these are gonna be text right here.

100
00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:08.405
So I'm gonna finish all of that first.

101
00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:10.579
So in order to get these
to layout correctly,

102
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.134
what does that look like to you?

103
00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:14.901
What are you gonna use
that we talked about?

104
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:15.632
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Still flex.

105
00:06:15.632 --> 00:06:17.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, it's gonna be flex,

106
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.341
good job.

107
00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:20.770
And they're the same height,
so how are we gonna do that?

108
00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:27.731
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Stretch, maybe.

109
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:35.353
Yeah, what is it, align item stretch?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

110
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:40.054
that's how you're gonna start with that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

111
00:06:40.054 --> 00:06:44.883
let's see, and then I would finish
this entire top row first, right?

112
00:06:44.883 --> 00:06:46.891
Before you even start on this one.

113
00:06:46.891 --> 00:06:49.200
Then on the second row,
this is gonna be 25%.

114
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.200
This one's gonna be 75%.

115
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.483
And I don't really care what the colors
are, just make these different colors.

116
00:06:55.483 --> 00:07:01.862
But notice that they're equally spaced and
they're in a column direction, right?

117
00:07:01.862 --> 00:07:05.283
So that was gonna be something
more like flex column, right?

118
00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:09.943
Flex direction column.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

119
00:07:09.943 --> 00:07:13.534
other things, Google everything.

120
00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:17.003
[LAUGH] When you forget it,
Google it again.

121
00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:19.674
It's not cheating,
it's literally what you're supposed to do.

122
00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:23.841
It's kind of the point,
you are professional Googlers.

123
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.763
So please, please,
please Google everything.

124
00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:29.725
It's not cheating.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Actually to that point,

125
00:07:29.725 --> 00:07:34.508
I saw a couple people on Windows having
trouble how to figure out how to

126
00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:37.340
open up an HTML file in Chrome.

127
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.231
And I forgot even though
I use Windows every day.

128
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.542
So I Googled it, and it's Ctrl+O, it will
let you get into your file explorer.

129
00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:46.765
That will then let you
open your HTML file,

130
00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:47.507
so,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

131
00:07:47.507 --> 00:07:53.406
perfect.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The image,

132
00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:57.727
the one that's being displayed there
is from a thing called placecorgi.

133
00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:01.692
[LAUGH] which I just love this website.

134
00:08:01.692 --> 00:08:06.008
So they're just random images of Corgis.

135
00:08:06.008 --> 00:08:13.921
[LAUGH] It's fantastic, right?

136
00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:20.952
So what this is, remember we were
talking about Lorem ipsum text?

137
00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:22.851
These are like place holder images.

138
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:26.021
So instead of Lorem Ipsum, it's images.

139
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:28.453
So with this, you can put a number.

140
00:08:28.453 --> 00:08:34.021
So place corgi.com/500/300,
it would be 500 width, 300 height.

141
00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:37.500
If you want it to be 600
then you do 600/300, right?

142
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.405
So you just give it dimensions and

143
00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:42.541
it gives you back an image of
a corgi in that dimension.

144
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:46.883
So I wanted it to be more wide than
it is tall, so I gave it 500/300.

145
00:08:46.883 --> 00:08:48.413
That's just useful for

146
00:08:48.413 --> 00:08:53.285
laying out websites.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

147
00:08:53.285 --> 00:08:58.848
that's a good thing to know, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The navigation box,

148
00:08:58.848 --> 00:09:01.753
which is this part down here,
that's the hardest part.

149
00:09:01.753 --> 00:09:04.421
So this is actually,
this uses display flex and

150
00:09:04.421 --> 00:09:08.963
then inside of it it uses display flex
again, so you have nested display flexes.

151
00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:13.919
That'll be useful to know.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a lot

152
00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.431
of room to reuse classes on this.

153
00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:18.504
You could probably make all the titles
one class, for example, right?

154
00:09:18.504 --> 00:09:21.731
So that's a good thing to keep in mind.

155
00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:23.403
Take it one step at a time,

156
00:09:23.403 --> 00:09:27.292
that's actually a big part of
programming just in general.

157
00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:30.573
When you are a programmer, they give you
large problems and the the point is to

158
00:09:30.573 --> 00:09:33.148
take a very large problem that
you don't know how to solve and

159
00:09:33.148 --> 00:09:36.553
just split it into two problems that are
hopefully a little bit easier to solve.

160
00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:38.931
And then, break those into smaller
problems and smaller problems,

161
00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:40.940
until eventually you'll
write something that's like,

162
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.170
I can do that, I know how to do that.

163
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:51.041
So break big problems into small problems.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

164
00:09:52.394 --> 00:09:53.926
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you see here, I said,

165
00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.670
here's my complete version.

166
00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:00.480
If you click on it,
that's an awesome picture.

167
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.322
You can see how I did it here.

168
00:10:02.322 --> 00:10:03.910
I gave you the complete thing.

169
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.579
You can open the Inspector and say,

170
00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:09.674
Inspect Element right here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The point here,

171
00:10:09.674 --> 00:10:11.100
this is not a test, right?

172
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.992
I just want you to learn.

173
00:10:12.992 --> 00:10:14.705
So that's why it's there.

174
00:10:14.705 --> 00:10:18.652
It's all, you can see here,
everything is all there.

175
00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:23.646
I would personally, for me, the way
that I learned, I need to struggle,

176
00:10:23.646 --> 00:10:25.950
so I would not first do this.

177
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.122
But if you get stuck and

178
00:10:27.122 --> 00:10:31.643
you're just frustrated like about to throw
your computer against the wall, don't.

179
00:10:31.643 --> 00:10:34.276
Maybe go out, don't do this right now,

180
00:10:34.276 --> 00:10:38.309
you should probably take an hour off and
breathe a little bit.

181
00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:42.766
But after that, just take it easy,
do what's best for you and

182
00:10:42.766 --> 00:10:45.150
your learning style.

183
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.856
That's what I wanna say.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

184
00:10:49.856 --> 00:10:53.869
you can cheat, that's fine, how I've
solved it is not the correct answer,

185
00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:55.431
that's what I wanted to say.

186
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:58.015
There are so many ways you could do this,

187
00:10:58.015 --> 00:11:02.651
you could totally do this using floats,
and that's just fine, right?

188
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:06.803
You could totally do this without
using flex and flex-direction-column.

189
00:11:06.803 --> 00:11:11.150
It's gonna be a million times
easier if you do it that way, but

190
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:16.793
totally up to you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

191
00:11:16.793 --> 00:11:20.895
saying there's a correct way is saying
that there's a correct way to write

192
00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:23.252
a poem or
a correct way to paint a portrait.

193
00:11:23.252 --> 00:11:31.984
There's artistry in here, as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And yeah, good luck.

194
00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:34.849
Does anyone have any questions
about the requirements or

195
00:11:34.849 --> 00:11:37.303
anything that we've talked
about at all today?

196
00:11:37.303 --> 00:11:39.900
Please?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You want us to have this

197
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.660
done by tomorrow morning?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

198
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.490
the first thing we'll do
tomorrow morning is walk through,

199
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:53.545
me writing it really quick.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

200
00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:55.444
thank you for attending the first day.

201
00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:59.103
You survived, that's a big deal,
you're 50% done.

202
00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:01.572
And you have learned two
of the three languages.

203
00:12:01.572 --> 00:12:03.704
We are done with HTML and CSS.

204
00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:06.541
This is like your HTML and CSS capstone.

205
00:12:06.541 --> 00:12:12.003
So you learned two languages today,
which is pretty damn cool.

206
00:12:12.003 --> 00:12:15.145
And not easy, you can seriously
feel pretty good about yourself.

207
00:12:15.145 --> 00:12:18.638
This is difficult stuff you
have accomplished here.

208
00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:22.000
So one, I'm proud of you for
sticking with it.

209
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.600
[LAUGH] And two, you just have
to learn one language tomorrow.
