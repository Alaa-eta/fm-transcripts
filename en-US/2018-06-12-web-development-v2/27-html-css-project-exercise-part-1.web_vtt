1
00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.651
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is
actually gonna be pretty good.

2
00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:06.305
We're gonna have enough time for
me to explain the project for

3
00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:11.044
you and then we can break for
the day, and you all can come back,

4
00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:14.287
and we can work out this project together.

5
00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:19.219
So this is actually gonna be you creating

6
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:24.150
an index file with a separate CSS file and

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.931
creating this kind of layout.

8
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:31.047
So this is gonna be in
HTML in a CSS project.

9
00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:33.400
You should have an index dot HTML file.

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.401
I would suggest creating its own folder.

11
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.970
You can put it on your desktop or
something like that and

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.482
inside of that folder,
have an index.html and have a styles.css.

13
00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:47.958
It doesn't actually really matter what you
call it as long as you're consistent and

14
00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.300
then you're going to create this website.

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.904
So this is something like a designer
would hand you this like hey,

16
00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:58.517
I created this in Photoshop or
InDesign or Sketch.

17
00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:03.119
Whatever the hipsters
are using these days,

18
00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:08.701
napkins, I'm not sure and
I want it to look like this.

19
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.733
And so you would go back and
you would use HTML, and

20
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:17.060
CSS to recreate basically
something of this nature.

21
00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:23.686
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you have all the tools.

22
00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:26.912
This is a far bigger project
than I've given you before, but

23
00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:31.420
I also think that it's useful for you to
try and struggle and Google, collaborate.

24
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.501
Feel free to talk to each other and
all those sorts of things.

25
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:42.668
And yeah, one thing I wanted to show you.

26
00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:46.517
So if I open my Visual Studio Code here.

27
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.704
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna create
a new file and just say,

28
00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:58.393
this goes on Desktop.

29
00:01:58.393 --> 00:02:02.168
I'm gonna call it FEM for Frontend Master.

30
00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:08.054
And inside of here,
I'm gonna put index.html.

31
00:02:08.054 --> 00:02:13.426
Well, one thing I'll show
you that's really useful,

32
00:02:13.426 --> 00:02:18.810
specifically with code if I put HTML5 and
just hit tab.

33
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.620
It generates all of that stuff for
me and I don't have to,

34
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.344
I can't remember that
off the top of my head.

35
00:02:26.344 --> 00:02:29.005
You can leave the meta stuff, as well.

36
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:32.552
They're basically just saying like this
is encoded in this particular way.

37
00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:37.900
This is how big I want the view port,
so you can leave that.

38
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.314
And I don't really actually know
what this one does, I just leave it.

39
00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:44.388
[LAUGH] It's one of those things
where like yeah, just leave it.

40
00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:45.690
It's fine.

41
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:54.800
We'll call this Frontend Masters and we'll
just put a h1 in here that says, lol.

42
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.450
So now, I have this HTML document.

43
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.296
I wanna show you how to
open it in your browser.

44
00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:02.787
So I have my browser open.

45
00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:08.010
This works with Chrome or
this works with basically any of them.

46
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.517
I'm gonna hit File &gt; Open File or
Cmd+O, that's usually what I do.

47
00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:16.810
I'm going to find it,
which is on my desktop.

48
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.270
I'm gonna go to FEM.

49
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.810
I'm gonna go index.html and
I'm gonna say, open.

50
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.987
So you open it just like you would a Word
document, but you do it with your browser

51
00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:32.800
and it's going to be on this,
normally you go to http://3 with this.

52
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.095
It's going to be file:///.

53
00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:39.750
What's happening here is your
computer is acting like a server.

54
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.040
So your computer's acting like
a server and serving itself.

55
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.410
Your file system is basically a server.

56
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.950
That's what's going on
behind like literally,

57
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.580
your browser's making requests
to your same computer.

58
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.231
That's how that works.

59
00:03:58.231 --> 00:04:00.241
So yeah, make sure have this open.

60
00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:05.579
And then if I come in here and
change this to say,

61
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.656
on g like that and I save it.

62
00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:13.200
And then I come over here if I hit Cmd+R,
it'll refresh the page and

63
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.652
I can see my changes.

64
00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:17.606
So you can kinda do that rapid iteration.

65
00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:24.113
Same thing, if you wanna create your
index.css, I'm gonna come in here to this.

66
00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:27.310
I'm gonna create a new
file by hitting Cmd+N.

67
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.213
I'm gonna say, styles.css.

68
00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:34.315
Again, there's no reason
it has to be called that.

69
00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:41.597
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna
put a new link tag in here.

70
00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:44.435
So the nice thing again about code is
I don't have to remember everything.

71
00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:45.710
I can just type link.

72
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.673
And then if I hit tab, it just generates
a link tag for me which is really nice.

73
00:04:51.673 --> 00:04:52.803
This is called Emmet.

74
00:04:52.803 --> 00:04:54.890
This is available in Sublime and
other things.

75
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.074
E-M-M-E-T.

76
00:04:57.074 --> 00:04:58.120
I'm not gonna show you how to do it.

77
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.482
In fact, there's a course on it from
Mike North on Frontend masters.

78
00:05:02.482 --> 00:05:05.532
I feel like I haven't plugged
Frontend Masters enough today, so

79
00:05:05.532 --> 00:05:06.648
I'm gonna do it again.

80
00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:08.002
Check that one out.

81
00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:12.544
Anyway, so I'm going to say ./styles.css.

82
00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:14.103
It's going to save that.

83
00:05:14.103 --> 00:05:19.258
And now, I'm going to say,
h1s have color red.

84
00:05:19.258 --> 00:05:20.878
Come back over here, refresh.

85
00:05:20.878 --> 00:05:21.378
Now, it's red.

86
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.434
I wanted to show you that cycle,

87
00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:27.014
cuz I don't want you be confused
about setting these things up.

88
00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:28.303
I don't really care about that.

89
00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:29.682
I want you to like learn to code.

90
00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:32.910
You can figure all those stuff later.

91
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.200
I would suggest taking this like one row
at a time like the first thing you should

92
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.926
do is you should make like the title
at the top, which is the New Times or

93
00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:46.796
whatever you wanna call the name
of your fake newspaper.

94
00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:52.023
I want you to make a row of stories.

95
00:05:52.023 --> 00:05:55.717
The one on the left and
the one on the right are gonna be 25% and

96
00:05:55.717 --> 00:05:58.110
the one in the middle is gonna be 50%.

97
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.331
There's gonna be an image
here in the middle and

98
00:06:01.331 --> 00:06:05.934
these are gonna be titles, and
these are gonna be texts right here.

99
00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:08.012
So I would finish all of that first.

100
00:06:08.012 --> 00:06:10.547
So in order to get these
to lay out correctly,

101
00:06:10.547 --> 00:06:12.366
what does that look like to you?

102
00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:14.965
What are you gonna use
that we talked about?

103
00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:15.831
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is this the flex?

104
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:17.167
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, it's gonna be flex.

105
00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:21.183
Good job and they're the same height,
so how are we gonna do that?

106
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:27.884
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Stretch maybe.

107
00:06:27.884 --> 00:06:30.433
Yeah, what is it?

108
00:06:30.433 --> 00:06:31.838
Align item stretch.

109
00:06:35.318 --> 00:06:39.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's how you're gonna start with that.

110
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.726
And we'll see, here's something and

111
00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:47.081
then I would finish this entire top row
first before we even start on this one.

112
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:49.647
Then on the second row,
this is gonna be 25%.

113
00:06:49.647 --> 00:06:51.727
This one's gonna be 75% and

114
00:06:51.727 --> 00:06:56.767
I don't really care what the colors
are just make these different colors,

115
00:06:56.767 --> 00:07:01.978
but notice that they're equally spaced and
they're in a column direction.

116
00:07:01.978 --> 00:07:06.880
So that was gonna be something
more flex direction column.

117
00:07:09.786 --> 00:07:13.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So other things,
Google everything.

118
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.231
[LAUGH] When you forget it,
Google it again.

119
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:19.783
It's not cheating,
it's literally what you're supposed to do.

120
00:07:19.783 --> 00:07:22.969
It's kind of the point,
you are professional Googlers.

121
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.920
So please, please,
please Google everything.

122
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.290
It's not cheating.

123
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.942
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Actually, to that point,
I saw a couple people on Windows having

124
00:07:32.942 --> 00:07:37.352
trouble how to figure out how to
open up an HTML file in Chrome.

125
00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:40.829
And I forgot even though I use
Windows every day, so I Googled it and

126
00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:43.759
it's Ctrl+O will let you get
into your file explorer.

127
00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:46.601
That will then let you
open your HTML file.

128
00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:48.618
So-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, perfect.

129
00:07:52.703 --> 00:07:53.433
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The image,

130
00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:57.966
the one that's being displayed there
is from a thing called Placecorgi.

131
00:07:57.966 --> 00:08:01.749
[LAUGH] Which I just love this website.

132
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:06.102
So they're just random images of corgis.

133
00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:12.320
[LAUGH] It's fantastic.

134
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.960
So remember we were talking
about Lorem Ipsum text?

135
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.030
These are placeholder images.

136
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.218
So instead of Lorem Ipsum, it's images.

137
00:08:26.218 --> 00:08:28.568
So with this, you can put a number.

138
00:08:28.568 --> 00:08:34.178
So placecorgi.com/500/300 would
be 500 width, 300 height.

139
00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:37.632
If you wanted it to be 600,
then you'd do 600/300.

140
00:08:37.632 --> 00:08:39.521
So you just give it dimensions and

141
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:42.628
it gives you back an image of
a corgi in that dimension.

142
00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:44.662
So I wanted it to be more
wide than it is tall.

143
00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:50.179
So I give it 500/300, that's just
useful for laying out websites.

144
00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:56.508
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's a good thing to know yet.

145
00:08:57.936 --> 00:09:00.508
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The navigation box
which is this part down here,

146
00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:01.959
that's the hardest part.

147
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:04.295
So this uses display flex.

148
00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:07.411
And then inside of it,
you use this display flex again, so

149
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:09.202
you have nested display flexes.

150
00:09:09.202 --> 00:09:11.872
That'll be useful to know.

151
00:09:11.872 --> 00:09:15.742
There's a lot of room to
reuse classes on this.

152
00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:18.695
You could probably make all
the titles one class, for example.

153
00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:21.820
So that's a good thing to keep in mind.

154
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.694
Take it one step at a time.

155
00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:27.541
That's actually a big part of
programming in just in general.

156
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.126
When you're a programmer,
they give you large problems and

157
00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:33.317
the point is to take a very large problem
that you don't know how to solve and

158
00:09:33.317 --> 00:09:36.734
just split it into two problems that are
hopefully a little bit easier to solve.

159
00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:38.516
And then break those
into smaller problems and

160
00:09:38.516 --> 00:09:41.126
smaller problems until eventually
the writer is like I can do that.

161
00:09:41.126 --> 00:09:42.258
I know how to do that.

162
00:09:42.258 --> 00:09:44.987
So break big problems
into smaller problems.

163
00:09:50.282 --> 00:09:52.395
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

164
00:09:52.395 --> 00:09:55.810
So if you see here, I said,
here's my complete version.

165
00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.678
If you click on it,
that's an awesome picture.

166
00:10:00.678 --> 00:10:02.444
You can see how I did it here.

167
00:10:02.444 --> 00:10:05.037
I gave you the complete thing,
you can open the inspector.

168
00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:08.787
And say, Inspect Element right here.

169
00:10:08.787 --> 00:10:11.234
The point here, this is not a test.

170
00:10:11.234 --> 00:10:13.101
I just want you to learn.

171
00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:14.906
So that's why it's there.

172
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:19.596
You can see here everything,
it's all there.

173
00:10:19.596 --> 00:10:22.812
Personally, for me, the way that I learn,
I need to struggle.

174
00:10:22.812 --> 00:10:25.848
So I would not first do this.

175
00:10:25.848 --> 00:10:28.631
But if you get stuck and
you're just frustrated and

176
00:10:28.631 --> 00:10:31.748
about to throw your computer
against the wall, don't.

177
00:10:31.748 --> 00:10:34.541
Maybe go out, don't do this right now.

178
00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:39.338
You should probably take like an hour
off and breathe a little bit, but

179
00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:41.710
after that just like take it easy.

180
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.824
Do what's best for you and
your learning style is what I wanna say.

181
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.060
So you can cheat, that's fine.

182
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.007
How I solved it is not the correct answer.

183
00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:55.589
That's what I wanted to say.

184
00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:58.328
There are so many ways you could do this.

185
00:10:58.328 --> 00:11:02.833
You could do this using floats and
that's just fine.

186
00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:06.925
You could totally do this without
using flex and flex direction column.

187
00:11:06.925 --> 00:11:11.552
It's gonna be a million times easier if

188
00:11:11.552 --> 00:11:16.469
you do it that way, but totally up to you.

189
00:11:16.469 --> 00:11:23.346
Yeah, same as correct way to write a poem
or a correct way to paint a portrait.

190
00:11:23.346 --> 00:11:25.960
There's artistry in here, as well.

191
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.176
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And yeah, good luck.

192
00:11:32.176 --> 00:11:35.319
Does anyone have any questions
about the requirements or

193
00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:37.421
anything we've talked at all today?

194
00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:38.253
Please.

195
00:11:38.253 --> 00:11:40.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you wanna us to
have this done by tomorrow morning?

196
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:40.956
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

197
00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:47.072
the first thing we'll do tomorrow morning
is walk through me writing it very quick.

198
00:11:54.132 --> 00:11:56.914
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Thank you for
attending the first day, you survived.

199
00:11:56.914 --> 00:12:01.808
That's a big deal, you're 50% done and you
have learned two of the three languages.

200
00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:03.902
We are done with HTML and CSS.

201
00:12:03.902 --> 00:12:06.580
This is like your HTML and CSS capstone.

202
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:13.617
So you learned two languages today,
which is pretty damn cool and not easy.

203
00:12:13.617 --> 00:12:15.379
You can seriously feel
pretty good about yourself.

204
00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:18.540
This is difficult stuff that
you have accomplished here.

205
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.725
So one, I'm proud of you for
sticking with it.

206
00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:26.600
[LAUGH] And two, you just have
to learn one language tomorrow.
