00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
if I have an h1 right here and

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.160
I wanted to make this h1 red,
something like this.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.050
So how would I do that?

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.630
You can't do that with just HTML.

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.740
You need something else to come in and
affect that.

6
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.560
So we're gonna write CSS
rule to make that the case.

7
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.260
So that is going to look like this.

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.143
This is what CSS looks like.

9
00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:28.630
So let's breakdown all of the pieces here.

10
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.660
I have an h1 right here, right?

11
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.320
This is called the selector.

12
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.630
The selector selects,
I think that follows, right?

13
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.890
So in this case it's gonna say,
every h1 on the page, if it is a h1,

14
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.840
then apply everything
between the curly braces.

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.570
Okay?

16
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.750
So, these are called curly braces,
in case you didn't know.

17
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.180
So it's apply everything
between the curly braces.

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.678
Now we only have one thing to
apply between the curly braces.

19
00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:07.450
We say color, colon, red.

20
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.190
Color is called a property.

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.236
So there's how many properties?

22
00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:15.453
I said it right there.

23
00:01:15.453 --> 00:01:17.930
There are about 350 properties.

24
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.960
This is a lot like HTML,

25
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.380
that you really are only gonna use again,
maybe 50 to 100 of them.

26
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.550
There's a lot and
there are people that are more

27
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.320
better at this than I am that will
probably use more things but for

28
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.750
the most part, there's gonna be about
50 of them that you're gonna use a lot.

29
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.240
And then the rest you're
rarely if ever going to use.

30
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.590
So color, as you may imagine,
is quite useful.

31
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.220
We use it quite a bit.

32
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.690
So, color is going to
change the font color.

33
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.360
That's just what it does.

34
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.110
It's one of those things that you kind of
just have to know what these things do.

35
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.150
And you can always Google it.

36
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.080
Like you could just Google how
do I change font color and

37
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.083
I guarantee it would be like one
of the first things on there.

38
00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:05.080
So
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I

39
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.336
put red here, this is called the value and

40
00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:14.300
red happens to be a value
that CSS understands.

41
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.580
It understands what red means.

42
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.840
So that's why this works.

43
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.520
It turns color red.

44
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.290
We saw hex before.

45
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.180
You can also put hex here.

46
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.530
In fact I'll put right here.

47
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.530
All the ones that CSS understands.

48
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.540
It understands a bunch of
different ways of doing color.

49
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.660
It understands hexadecimal.

50
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.560
It understands RGB.

51
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.070
This is how you do RGB right here.

52
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.880
And it also understands HSL.

53
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.870
Which I do not know
nearly enough about HSL.

54
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.100
It stands for hue, saturation and
lightness, I think.

55
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.752
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Luminosity.

56
00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:53.404
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Luminosity.

57
00:02:53.404 --> 00:02:55.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

58
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's mystery.

59
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.568
I'm just kidding.

60
00:02:58.568 --> 00:03:02.027
I never use it, I'll put it that way.

61
00:03:02.027 --> 00:03:06.537
[LAUGH] And then it understand 150
what are called named colors and

62
00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:09.000
there's some really named colors.

63
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.579
But if you understand more about like
how CSS can do colors, I put a link to

64
00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.330
an article there in CSS tricks,
really explains everything really well.

65
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.834
And I'm not going to explain
it to you anymore than that

66
00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:26.628
but.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

67
00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:28.970
then you see here there is a ;.

68
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.790
That's just punctuation in CSS.

69
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.060
It's saying I am done with this sentence.

70
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.720
It really is like a period or
a full stop for CSS.

71
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.900
At the end of every line,
you just put a ; to say, I'm done and

72
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.919
I'm gonna go onto the next thing.

73
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.982
It does have to be there
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I can put a lot

74
00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:56.325
of things inside this rules, it does just
have to be one thing, you can see here,

75
00:03:56.325 --> 00:04:00.665
I do a lot more, so a new another color,
lime green is the color.

76
00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:06.280
Font-size: 60 pixels,
that's the px stands for.

77
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.980
There are lots of ways to,
of doing measurements in CSS.

78
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.160
So just like I can say that like I'm,
this person's five foot tall or so

79
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.740
many centimeters tall or somewhat like,
they're like 0.0001 miles tall.

80
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.390
Right?
Like there's many different measurements

81
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.120
for doing height.

82
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.620
Just like there is for CSS,
you can do it in pixels.

83
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.590
You can do it in EM's, you can do it in x.

84
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.280
You can do it in the centimeters,
you can do it in inches.

85
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.300
There's a lot of ways to do that.

86
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.825
I will say that mostly you
really only use pixels and EM's.

87
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:48.930
E-M.

88
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.900
That's maybe about it.

89
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.600
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

90
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.830
why are you defining the font
size if you're already doing h1,

91
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.080
that determines how big it is?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

92
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.361
So why are we using,
telling it a different font

93
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:07.657
size?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I guess, maybe that's what

94
00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:11.740
our designs dictated, that we wanted it to
be bigger or smaller, something like that.

95
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.130
I think the default font size for
h1 is like 36, if I'm not mistaken?

96
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.530
36 pixels, so you can see here,
this is quite large.

97
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.492
So the reason why we would do that
is because we want it to be larger.

98
00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.122
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We designed it for

99
00:05:27.122 --> 00:05:30.580
some reason to be larger than that.

100
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.273
Cuz we wanted to.

101
00:05:31.273 --> 00:05:35.210
[LAUGH] I don't know if I have
a better explanation than that.

102
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.824
Does that answer your question?

103
00:05:35.824 --> 00:05:36.343
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or

104
00:05:36.343 --> 00:05:37.166
not answer your question?

105
00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:42.510
[LAUGH] It is a good question though.

106
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.260
Or for example, what if we
wanted it to not be bold, right?

107
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.940
Cuz by default, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I was just wondering if you

108
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.030
could explain EM's.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure, I think I have on

109
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.530
here as well, another CSS tricks
article about measurements.

110
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.760
So, I will explain EM's
because they are useful.

111
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.840
A lot of times,
we're doing relative sizes.

112
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.270
We want things to be
like relatively sized,

113
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.010
rather than just being
like absolutely sized.

114
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.580
And so, pixels is an absolute sizing,
it's actually not literally pixels,

115
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.580
just so you know but we call them that.

116
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.850
EMs is measured in relation
to what your font choice is.

117
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.550
Right?
So if I change fonts,

118
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.360
then I want the sizing to
be relative to the font.

119
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.600
So what it actually does is it
measures the width of a lower case m.

120
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.720
That, something like that, right?

121
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.349
And that's what Ems is,
it's literally EMs long.

122
00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.161
Weird, right?

123
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:51.050
[LAUGH] But it ends up being really useful
because that means even if you changed

124
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.290
fonts, all of your measurements will
change in relation to your font.

125
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.479
It's a little confusing but
it actually ends up being quite nice.

126
00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:08.175
There's also ex, ex and that's the height
of a lower case x, I never used that one.

127
00:07:08.175 --> 00:07:12.223
[LAUGH] So, but you can see
the CSS tricks here, article for

128
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.170
to see all the rest of them.

129
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.331
And that's how you write em's right there,
it's.

130
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:19.392
Cool.

131
00:07:19.392 --> 00:07:23.781
Any questions on

132
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:31.630
measurements furthermore?

133
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.680
I measure almost everything in pixels,
probably more things than I should.

134
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.031
It's just something that I've done for so
long that you just get used to doing it

135
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:42.515
that way.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You

136
00:07:42.515 --> 00:07:47.298
will see things occasionally in rem's,
there is some weird

137
00:07:47.298 --> 00:07:52.268
behaviors if you have resized em's,
I don't really wanna get

138
00:07:52.268 --> 00:07:56.990
too deep into that rabbit holes,
it's a deep rabbit hole.

139
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.503
So you can have rems which are root em's.

140
00:07:59.503 --> 00:08:04.527
Which are ends measured at the root
level which is like the top

141
00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:09.070
level of the page or
like based on the bodies and width.

142
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.300
We're gonna leave it at that.

143
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.490
It's, basically, it's ends that do not,

144
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.835
are not affected by the command
configuration or like pinch to zoom or

145
00:08:18.835 --> 00:08:24.042
things like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

146
00:08:28.972 --> 00:08:30.154
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, next thing I

147
00:08:30.154 --> 00:08:34.631
want to talk about is font weight,
so you can make things bold or

148
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:38.690
not bold and that's how you
do that with the font weight.

149
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.135
So h1's are bold by default, if you wanna
make them not bold, you have to say,

150
00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:49.660
font-weight normal and
you can also do light as well.

151
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.160
So if you want it to be like extra thin.

152
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.320
Text-decoration, you'll notice
that this is underline, right?

153
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.690
You can see the green underling
right there, that's how you do that.

154
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.170
You can also do overline, which I dont
know why you'd ever want to do that.

155
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.130
But you can.

156
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.080
It's a thing.

157
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.090
And there's also line through if
you want to do strike-through.

158
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.310
Text transform.

159
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.790
So you'll notice here that
this is all in upper case.

160
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.900
Despite the fact that this is an h1
with normal casing, it's something

161
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.590
you can do at CSS is say make this whole
uppercase, just kind of interesting.

162
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.830
Word of caution,
I used to do localization for

163
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.660
Netflix which is like tanslating
from language to language, right?

164
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.670
And I did all the coding for that.

165
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.720
And if you do text transform upper case,

166
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.880
it changes the meanings
in different languages.

167
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.510
Like for example, I know with Turkish,
it kind of messes with

168
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.170
the meaning depending if it's
upper case or lower case.

169
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.130
So be careful, if you're developing for

170
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.250
different languages that you dont
do text transform upper case.

171
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.500
We had to remove that a lot
throughout the Netflix code base.

172
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.410
You can also do lowercase or capitalize,

173
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.700
which will capitalize like
the beginning of every word.

174
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.170
That works too.

175
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.800
A border of 3 pixels, solid pink.

176
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.019
So, it's kind of hard to see there but
there is a pink border there, I promise.

177
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.900
That is three pixels wide and it's solid.

178
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:25.530
So this is called a combined CSS property.

179
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.820
Cuz you can see there, we have three
different values for one property, right?

180
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.600
It's solid, it's pink and
it's three pixels wide.

181
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.054
This is actual combination of border
style solid, border color pink and

182
00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:38.597
border width 3 pixels.

183
00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:42.922
This is called like a short hand CSS
properly that you can kinda shuff them all

184
00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:47.315
together, you'll see that lot that's why
what I want to show you that kind of

185
00:10:47.315 --> 00:10:51.180
up front but you can totally
changes this by 5 pixels wide.

186
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.210
You can change this to be like
double border or dashed or

187
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.430
dotted borders and obviously,
this can be any number of colors.

188
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.430
So you'll see that a lot, so
just kinda get used to it.

189
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.290
Parents and children, does anyone have
any questions about what's going on here?

190
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.290
Please?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So in my browser both

191
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.370
my Mozilla and the Chrome,
it's actually making a pink box,

192
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.910
is that what you're talking about?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

193
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Or an actual

194
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.430
letters.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

195
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just can't see it.

196
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:29.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You just can't see

197
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.472
it so.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Make sure

198
00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:34.854
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, let's just,

199
00:11:34.854 --> 00:11:37.980
like make this like black.

200
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.480
So you can see it, yeah.

201
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.510
It's just, I choose a bad colour for
this projector.

202
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.740
We will talk a lot more
about the selector,

203
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.415
there's actually a whole section on
it because it's a complicated beast.

204
00:11:51.415 --> 00:11:54.261
[LAUGH] Yeah, cool.
