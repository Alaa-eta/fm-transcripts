00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.936
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if I have an h1 right here, so

2
00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:08.175
then I wanted to make this h1 red,
something like this.

3
00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.931
So how would I do that?

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.756
You can't do that with just html.

5
00:00:12.756 --> 00:00:16.071
You need something else to come in and
affect that.

6
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:20.438
So we're gonna write CSS
rule to make that the case.

7
00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:22.269
So that is going to look like this.

8
00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.196
This is what CSS looks like.

9
00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:29.117
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's break down all of the pieces here.

10
00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:32.857
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have an h1 right here,
right?

11
00:00:32.857 --> 00:00:36.560
This is called the selector.

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.621
The selector selects.

13
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.513
I think that follows, right?

14
00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:45.555
So in this case, it's gonna say,
every h1 on the page, if it is an h1,

15
00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:49.553
then apply everything between
the curly braces, okay?

16
00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:52.077
So,these are called curly braces,
in case you didn't know.

17
00:00:54.127 --> 00:00:58.429
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [COUGH] So it's apply
everything between the curly braces.

18
00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.021
Now we only have one.

19
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:04.559
Thing to apply between the curly braces.

20
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.374
We say the color red.

21
00:01:07.374 --> 00:01:10.343
Color is called a property.

22
00:01:10.343 --> 00:01:14.224
So there's how many properties.

23
00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:15.040
I said it right there.

24
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.374
There are about 350 properties.

25
00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:22.222
This is a lot like HTML that
you really are only gonna use,

26
00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:25.457
again, maybe 50 to 100 of them.

27
00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:29.705
There's a lot, and there are people
that are better at this than I am,

28
00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:31.945
that will probably use more things.

29
00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:36.438
But for the most part, there's gonna be
about 50 of them that you're gonna use

30
00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:40.093
a lot, and then the rest you're rarely,
if ever, going to use.

31
00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:42.546
So color, as you may imagine,
is quite useful.

32
00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:44.047
We use it quite a bit.

33
00:01:44.047 --> 00:01:48.877
So color is going to
change the font color.

34
00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:50.031
That's just what it does.

35
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:54.189
It's one of those things where you just
have to know what these things do.

36
00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.146
And you can always Google it.

37
00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:57.438
You could just Google how
do I change font color, and

38
00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:00.055
I guarantee you it would be one
of the first things on there.

39
00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:07.211
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I'd put red here.

40
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:14.281
This is called the value, and red happens
to be a value that CSS understands.

41
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.468
It understands what red means.

42
00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:19.003
So that's why this works.

43
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.055
It turns the color red.

44
00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.315
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We saw hex before.

45
00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:26.029
You can also put hex here.

46
00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.497
The fact that I put right here,
all the ones that CSS understands.

47
00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:32.528
It understands a bunch of
different ways of doing color.

48
00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:35.519
It understands hexadecimal.

49
00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.268
It understands RGB.

50
00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:40.172
This is how you would do RGB, right here.

51
00:02:40.172 --> 00:02:42.801
And it also understands HSL.

52
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:47.471
Which I do not know nearly enough
about HSL, it stands for hue,

53
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:50.484
saturation, and lightness, I think.

54
00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:54.068
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Luminosity [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Luminosity,

55
00:02:54.068 --> 00:02:58.443
it's a mystery, I'm just kidding.

56
00:02:58.443 --> 00:02:59.994
I don't know, I never use it,
I'll put it that way.

57
00:02:59.994 --> 00:03:06.754
[LAUGH] And then it understands a hundred
and fifty what are called named colors.

58
00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:09.113
And there's some really
weird named colors.

59
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:14.287
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But if you wanna understand
more about like how CSS can do colors,

60
00:03:14.287 --> 00:03:16.754
I put in a link to an article
there in CSS tricks,

61
00:03:16.754 --> 00:03:19.006
really explains everything really well.

62
00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:23.029
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I'm not going to
explain it to you any more than that.

63
00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.713
But,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you see here,

64
00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:28.869
there is a semicolon.

65
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.982
That's just punctuation in CSS,
it's saying I am done with this sentence.

66
00:03:32.982 --> 00:03:37.689
This really is like a period or
a full stop for CSS.

67
00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.638
At the end of every line, you just
put a semicolon to say I'm done and

68
00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.664
I'm gonna go on to the next thing.

69
00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:44.684
It does have to be there.

70
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.128
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I can put a lot
of things inside these rules,

71
00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:55.713
it doesn't just have to be one thing.

72
00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:58.093
You can see here I do a lot more.

73
00:03:58.093 --> 00:04:02.276
So I can do another color,
lime green is the color.

74
00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:06.190
Font size, 60 pixels,
that's what the px stands for.

75
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.830
There are lots of ways of
doing measurments in CSS.

76
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.904
So just like I can say that I'm this
person's five foot tall or so many

77
00:04:16.904 --> 00:04:22.961
centimeters tall or so They're like point
zero zero zero one miles tall, right?

78
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:26.155
There's like many
different measurements for

79
00:04:26.155 --> 00:04:28.876
doing height just like there is for CSS.

80
00:04:28.876 --> 00:04:32.828
You can do it in pixels,
you can do it in EMs, you can do it in X,

81
00:04:32.828 --> 00:04:36.254
you can do it in centimeters,
you can do it in inches.

82
00:04:36.254 --> 00:04:39.221
There's a lot of ways to do that.

83
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:44.728
I will say that mostly,
you really only use pixels and EMs.

84
00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:50.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's maybe about it,
yeah.

85
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.882
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So why are you defining
the font size if you're already doing h1?

86
00:04:54.882 --> 00:04:57.127
That determines how big it is.

87
00:04:57.127 --> 00:04:58.227
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

88
00:04:58.227 --> 00:05:05.465
So why are we telling it
a different font size?

89
00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:09.293
Our designs dictated that we
wanted it to be bigger or

90
00:05:09.293 --> 00:05:11.731
smaller or something like that.

91
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:16.603
I think the default font size for
H1 is 36 if I'm not mistaken,

92
00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:20.960
36 pixels, so
you can see here that this is quite large.

93
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.401
So the reason why we would do that is
because we wanted it to be larger.

94
00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:30.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We designed it for
some reason to be larger than that.

95
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.601
Because we wanted to.

96
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.200
[LAUGH] I don't have a better
explantion than that.

97
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.478
Does that answer your question,
or not answer your question?

98
00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:42.032
[LAUGH] It is a good question, though.

99
00:05:42.032 --> 00:05:47.167
Or for example,
what if we want it to not be bold, right?

100
00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:50.917
Cuz by default, yeah.

101
00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:54.479
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I was just wondering
if you could explain EMs?

102
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure,
I think I have on here as well,

103
00:05:57.904 --> 00:06:02.557
another CSS tricks article
about measurements.

104
00:06:02.557 --> 00:06:06.397
So I will explain EMs
because they are useful.

105
00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:10.787
A lot of times we're doing relative sizes.

106
00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:14.958
We want things to be relatively sized
rather than being absolutely sized.

107
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.151
So pixels is an absolute sizing.

108
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.298
It's actually not literally pixels,
just so you know.

109
00:06:19.298 --> 00:06:23.257
But we call them that.

110
00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:27.027
EMs is measured in relation to
what your font choice is, right?

111
00:06:27.027 --> 00:06:33.337
So if I change fonts then I want
the sizing to be relative to the font.

112
00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:37.355
So what it actually does is measure
the width of a lower case m,

113
00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.538
something like that,
and that's what m's is.

114
00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:45.973
It's literally EMs long, weird, right?

115
00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:50.517
[LAUGH] But it ends up being really useful
because that means even if you change

116
00:06:50.517 --> 00:06:54.713
fonts, all of your measurement will
change in relation to your font.

117
00:06:56.485 --> 00:07:00.983
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a little confusing,
but it actually ends up being quite nice.

118
00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:06.374
There's also x ex, and
that's the height of a lower case x.

119
00:07:06.374 --> 00:07:07.223
I never use that one.

120
00:07:07.223 --> 00:07:15.565
[LAUGH] But you can see the CSS tricks
here article to see all the rest of them.

121
00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:20.832
And that's how you write EMs

122
00:07:20.832 --> 00:07:26.767
right there, it's Cool.

123
00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:31.404
Any questions about
measurements furthermore?

124
00:07:31.404 --> 00:07:34.557
I measure almost everything in pixels,
probably more things than I should.

125
00:07:34.557 --> 00:07:36.529
It's just something that I've done for so

126
00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.066
long that you just kind of get
used to doing it that way.

127
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You will see
things occasionally in REMs.

128
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.766
There's some weird behaviors
if you have resized EMs.

129
00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:56.991
I don't really wanna get too deep into
that rabbit hole, it's a deep rabbit hole.

130
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:59.723
So you can have rems, which are root EMs.

131
00:07:59.723 --> 00:08:03.545
Which are, Is measured at the root level,

132
00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:09.592
which is the top level of the page,
or based on the bodies, Width.

133
00:08:11.881 --> 00:08:13.112
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're
gonna leave it at that.

134
00:08:13.112 --> 00:08:17.883
Basically, EMs are not affected
by the command configuration, or

135
00:08:17.883 --> 00:08:20.405
pinch to zoom and things like that.

136
00:08:23.652 --> 00:08:31.812
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so next thing
I wanna talk about is font weight.

137
00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:34.466
So you can make things bold or not bold.

138
00:08:34.466 --> 00:08:39.201
And that's how you do
that with font weight.

139
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:44.439
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So h1's are bold by default
if you wanna make them not bold you

140
00:08:44.439 --> 00:08:46.584
have to say font-weight: normal.

141
00:08:46.584 --> 00:08:52.490
And you can also do light as well so
if you want it to be extra thin.

142
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.247
Text decoration, you'll notice
that this is underlined, right?

143
00:08:56.247 --> 00:08:59.237
You can see the green
underlining right there.

144
00:08:59.237 --> 00:09:00.673
That's how you do that.

145
00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.647
You can also do overline.

146
00:09:02.647 --> 00:09:06.101
Which, I don't know why you'd ever
want to do that, but you can.

147
00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:07.274
It's a thing.

148
00:09:07.274 --> 00:09:12.350
And there's also line through if you want
to do strike through, text transform.

149
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.913
So you'll notice here,
that this is all in upper case despite

150
00:09:16.913 --> 00:09:21.325
the fact that this says,
this is an h1 with normal casing.

151
00:09:21.325 --> 00:09:25.721
That's something you can do with CSS and
say, make this all upper case,

152
00:09:25.721 --> 00:09:28.692
which is kind of interesting,
word of caution.

153
00:09:28.692 --> 00:09:33.582
I used to do localization for
Netflix which is like translating from

154
00:09:33.582 --> 00:09:37.720
language to language, and
I did all the coding for that.

155
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.138
And if you do text transform uppercase
it changes the meanings in different

156
00:09:42.138 --> 00:09:42.918
languages.

157
00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:46.811
For example I know with Turkish it kind of
messes with the meaning depending if it's

158
00:09:46.811 --> 00:09:48.045
uppercase or lowercase.

159
00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:50.381
So be careful if you're developing for

160
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:54.428
different languages that you don't
do text transform uppercase.

161
00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:59.511
We had to remove that a lot
through the Netflix code base.

162
00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:01.357
You can also do lowercase or capitalize,

163
00:10:01.357 --> 00:10:03.637
which will capitlize
the beginning of every word.

164
00:10:03.637 --> 00:10:04.711
That works, too.

165
00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:12.866
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Border 3 pixels, solid
pink, so it's kind of hard to see there,

166
00:10:12.866 --> 00:10:16.786
but there is a pink border there,
I promise.

167
00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:20.670
That is 3 pixels wide and it's solid.

168
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.269
So this is called a combined CSS
property cuz you can see there we have

169
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:28.752
three different values for
one property, right?

170
00:10:28.752 --> 00:10:32.494
It's solid, it's pink and
it's 3 pixels wide.

171
00:10:32.494 --> 00:10:37.286
This is actually the combination of
border style solid, border color pink and

172
00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:38.964
border with three pixels.

173
00:10:38.964 --> 00:10:43.172
This is called like a short hand CSS
property that you can kinda shuffle

174
00:10:43.172 --> 00:10:44.397
them all together.

175
00:10:44.397 --> 00:10:45.309
You'll see that a lot.

176
00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:48.631
That's why I wanted to show
you that kind of up front.

177
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:51.181
But you can totally just
use five pixels wide.

178
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:56.121
You can change this to be double border or
dashed or

179
00:10:56.121 --> 00:11:02.597
dotted borders, and obviously
this can be any number of colors.

180
00:11:02.597 --> 00:11:08.385
So you'll see that a lot so
just kind of get used to it.

181
00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:12.369
Parents and children,
does anyone have any questions about.

182
00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:13.635
What's going on here?

183
00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:17.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

184
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.006
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So in my browser,
both my Mozilla and

185
00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:25.652
the Chrome,
it's actually making the pink box.

186
00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:26.826
Is that what your talking about,
around the actual letters?

187
00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:28.043
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

188
00:11:28.043 --> 00:11:29.107
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You just can't see it.

189
00:11:29.107 --> 00:11:30.079
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You just can't see it, so.

190
00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:33.273
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just want
to make sure nothing's-

191
00:11:33.273 --> 00:11:37.269
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's just make this black

192
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:39.878
so you can see it.

193
00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:43.379
I chose a bad color for this projector.

194
00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:46.745
We'll talk a lot more about the selector.

195
00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:53.619
There's actually a whole section on it
because it's a complicated beast [LAUGH].

196
00:11:53.619 --> 00:11:54.261
Yeah, cool.
