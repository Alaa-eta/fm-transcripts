00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.247
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So hopefully you've
absorbed a little bit about HTML and

2
00:00:05.247 --> 00:00:07.550
count what the uses are.

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.637
We're pretty much, I feel pretty good
about where we are with HTML with how much

4
00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:14.633
you've been taught and
how much you understand about it.

5
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:19.604
We're going have another brief,
maybe ten-minute lesson,

6
00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:24.198
more about the meta level of HTML,
just like structure and

7
00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:28.998
the boring parts of it,
if we're being completely honest.

8
00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:32.676
And then we're gonna get into some CSS,
which will,

9
00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:35.792
I think being a little bit more fun,
I think.

10
00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:37.736
So do we have any questions
before we get started?

11
00:00:41.778 --> 00:00:45.092
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,
obviously everything made perfect sense,

12
00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:48.029
that's what I'm taking out of this, cool.

13
00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:53.368
So we are on the meta HTML section,
section 6.

14
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:59.018
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So most of what
I've been trying to show you so

15
00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:03.229
far is like visual and concrete and
things that are a little bit more,

16
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.735
it's easy to see like if I
change this then I can see this.

17
00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:11.399
What we're gonna do now is gonna
be a little bit more subtle in

18
00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.349
like how it affects your documents
that you're creating here.

19
00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:22.001
So let's just start with the bare bones
of basic skeleton of an HTML document.

20
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.446
Right now everything we've been doing
now is in the confines of these little

21
00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:27.353
playgrounds.

22
00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.797
But that's not usually actually
how you write in code.

23
00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:32.944
Normally you're in your editor and
you're creating like index HTML and

24
00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:34.344
it has a bunch of stuff, right?

25
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:38.874
And there's a certain amount of just
like base layer stuff that you need.

26
00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:42.133
Like the term for that is boiler plate.

27
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.903
Do not know why it's called boilder plate.

28
00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:49.628
But when someone says boiler plate it
means just like this repeated stuff that

29
00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:51.672
you always have to have, right?

30
00:01:51.672 --> 00:01:53.425
Basically it's like what you copy and

31
00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:56.344
paste from the last project to
get started on the next project.

32
00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:57.319
Cuz we all do it.

33
00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.586
[LAUGH] And that's okay.

34
00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.333
I do it every time I start a new project.

35
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:05.889
So this is right here that I have,
these ten lines.

36
00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:12.804
This is the base layer of what it
takes to have a basic HTML document.

37
00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:18.813
And we're gonna dissect it line by line so
you understand what's going on.

38
00:02:18.813 --> 00:02:21.672
So we can see all these ten lines of code,

39
00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:24.796
all that comes out of
here is Check this out.

40
00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.910
That's it, which is the H1, right?

41
00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:32.238
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
let's talk about the rest of it here.

42
00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:37.482
So the doc type HTML,
the very very first thing right here.

43
00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I was
talking about it before,

44
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:43.463
this is HTML 5.1 that
you're learning here.

45
00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:47.372
HTML 5 has been out for
like a decade, I'm gonna guess,

46
00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:50.069
it's been out a decent amount of time.

47
00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.261
It's to the point that HTML 5 is not
even a thing that we really say anymore,

48
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:55.911
it's just HTML now, right?

49
00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.567
That's just kinda the base layer
assumption that everything is HTML now.

50
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:05.127
So the reason why we have this
thing right here is we need to

51
00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:08.557
let the browser know we're doing HTML 5.

52
00:03:08.557 --> 00:03:12.461
We're doing the latest version of HTML,
and that's what this thing right here,

53
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.884
the DOCTYPE as it's called.

54
00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:17.559
You can give it other DOCTYPE
headers to use older versions, but

55
00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.315
I do not understand why you would
ever want to do that to yourself.

56
00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:26.143
But there's strict HTML blah blah blah,
I can't remember what they are because

57
00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:28.916
it's been so
long since I've worked with it.

58
00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:33.907
It's been literally since the beginning of
my first job that I've done anything else

59
00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:35.302
besides DOCTYPE html.

60
00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:37.789
And they look more or less all like this.

61
00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:39.990
It does have to be literally
the first line of the code.

62
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.580
You can't even do a space here,
it has to be literally the first line.

63
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.370
So that always should be there.

64
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.530
The next thing that you're gonna have is
this HTML tag that's closed down here.

65
00:03:57.292 --> 00:04:00.447
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's just everything
that goes inside of your HTML tag.

66
00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:02.372
That's just the way that works.

67
00:04:02.372 --> 00:04:05.956
It's letting you know the beginning and
the ending of your doc.

68
00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:09.087
And then it's gonna have this lang=en,

69
00:04:09.087 --> 00:04:12.762
en as you may have guessed,
stands for English.

70
00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:15.325
And you're just letting the browser know,

71
00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:18.661
it's like hey,
I'm sending an English document down.

72
00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:21.971
You could put es there,
which would be Spanish.

73
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:25.263
Like you would send whatever language
you're putting that in there so

74
00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:26.443
that the browser knows.

75
00:04:26.443 --> 00:04:29.521
It's like, cool,
you're about to receive Japanese.

76
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:32.434
Be prepared to receive Japanese,
that kinda stuff, right?

77
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.357
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Also, just as a side note,

78
00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:39.363
your browser has a language that's set for
it.

79
00:04:39.363 --> 00:04:42.743
It's usually set by,
I downloaded this browser in America,

80
00:04:42.743 --> 00:04:45.278
it just assumed that I
want to speak English and

81
00:04:45.278 --> 00:04:48.798
it assumes that I will change it
if I don't wanna speak English.

82
00:04:48.798 --> 00:04:53.648
So my browser's actually requesting
English from wherever website I go to, and

83
00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:55.871
then it's receiving English back.

84
00:04:55.871 --> 00:05:01.327
So, that's done through headers, which we
will talk about headers in a little bit.

85
00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:05.094
But basically it's meta information that
I'm sending from my browser saying hey,

86
00:05:05.094 --> 00:05:06.696
do you have any English documents?

87
00:05:06.696 --> 00:05:07.951
And then it sends back.

88
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:11.759
And with this it says yes,
here's your English document.

89
00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.628
So again, we'll get more into
headers later in the course.

90
00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:19.939
So that's what the HTML lang equals that.

91
00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:25.245
Okay, we're gonna talk about head here for
a second, which is this one right here.

92
00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:29.084
Now keep in mind that there is a header
and a head, and they are different.

93
00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:34.003
So we're talking about head at this
moment in time, just so you know.

94
00:05:34.003 --> 00:05:38.295
Every HTML document has a head and
has a body.

95
00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:44.792
And in the head goes all the meta
information about your document.

96
00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:48.446
So in this particular case,
we're just putting the title.

97
00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:52.186
And the title is like if you
Google something and the,

98
00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:55.942
what's the, well,
let's just Google something.

99
00:05:55.942 --> 00:06:00.771
If I Google Front end masters,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

100
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:05.353
this part right here is
what's in their title, right?

101
00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:08.233
So it's the title of the document.

102
00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:09.629
That's what goes in title.

103
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:15.120
It's also if I click on this it's
gonna be what's up here in the tab.

104
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.925
So it's also what goes right there, right?

105
00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:20.490
That is the title.

106
00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:25.003
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's weird,
I've been watching myself.

107
00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:30.779
[LAUGH] Okay so
that's where the title goes in there.

108
00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.037
You should call whatever the document
is like this one is called Intro to

109
00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:34.642
Web Dev V2.

110
00:06:34.642 --> 00:06:38.191
It makes sense so when someone
navigates to some other tab it's like

111
00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:41.757
okay there's by Web Dev document I'm
just gonna click back on that one.

112
00:06:41.757 --> 00:06:43.211
So that should always be there.

113
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:46.397
There are lots of other
things that can go in head.

114
00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:49.457
You can configure the viewport,
for example.

115
00:06:49.457 --> 00:06:54.249
So the viewport is,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do I wanna

116
00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:55.115
explain that?

117
00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:59.767
If I'm on a mobile phone do I want
the website to shrink to the size of

118
00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:00.609
the phone?

119
00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:01.945
Or do I want it to continue like so

120
00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:04.424
they have to scroll side-to-side
to see the whole thing?

121
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.620
You can configure those sorts
of things inside of the head.

122
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.109
It's just like the meta information that
the user doesn't necessarily see but

123
00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:13.857
still needs to be configured.

124
00:07:13.857 --> 00:07:15.811
That stuff all goes in head.

125
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:21.138
All of your CSS Links all
go in the head as well.

126
00:07:21.138 --> 00:07:22.956
There's some other things as well.

127
00:07:24.942 --> 00:07:28.586
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So basically if it's
a thing that's not shown to the user but

128
00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:33.173
it's used to configure your website,
those sorts of things go in the head.

129
00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:34.996
Any questions about head?

130
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.659
It's kind of a nebulous, I know.

131
00:07:40.384 --> 00:07:43.725
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, body.

132
00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:46.829
So the things that go in body is
what we've been writing so far,

133
00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:49.534
it's all your divs,
spans, etc., etc., right?

134
00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:52.152
All that stuff is going in your body,

135
00:07:52.152 --> 00:07:55.536
that's the stuff that
people are going to see.

136
00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:57.539
So it's where our H1 went.

137
00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:59.577
I put a comment in there, Yeah.

138
00:08:02.362 --> 00:08:03.768
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then that is like,

139
00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:07.554
this is the bare minimum stuff
that you need to run a website.

140
00:08:10.008 --> 00:08:13.435
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's actually a couple
other things that probably should be in

141
00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:16.195
there, but we're ignoring for
now, which is okay.

142
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.907
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

143
00:08:22.907 --> 00:08:28.699
So the last thing I want to talk
about are script, style and link.

144
00:08:30.837 --> 00:08:37.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So script is how you
link JavaScript files into your HTML.

145
00:08:37.113 --> 00:08:40.719
It's cuz your HTML and your JavaScript
files are gonna be separate files.

146
00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:42.955
You're not gonna put them together,
you're gonna separate them.

147
00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:46.368
And believe me,
it's gonna end up being better.

148
00:08:46.368 --> 00:08:49.731
So that's gonna be linked
in via a script tag.

149
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:51.517
And it's the same thing with link.

150
00:08:51.517 --> 00:08:54.458
Link is how you bring in all of your CSS.

151
00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:58.308
And again, your CSS is gonna
live in a different file, and

152
00:08:58.308 --> 00:09:01.147
you're gonna be brought in via a link tag.

153
00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:05.579
Today we're gonna be using a lot of style
tags, just because I want you to be able

154
00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:09.364
to see your HTML and your CSS at
the same time and be able to edit them.

155
00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:11.593
That's not typically how
you're gonna do things.

156
00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.533
You're typically gonna have
a link tag with a separate CSS

157
00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:16.275
file that's gonna be brought in.

158
00:09:16.275 --> 00:09:21.163
But just for today, just for demonstration
purposes we're to be using style tags.

159
00:09:21.163 --> 00:09:25.191
So we'll get more into that when
we kinda get there, but just so

160
00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:30.450
you know this is a typical, you definitely
do not want to use style tags normally.

161
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.413
So what a style tag is that you can
actually put CSS inside of the style

162
00:09:35.413 --> 00:09:36.992
tag and it will work.

163
00:09:36.992 --> 00:09:40.168
We'll see what that looks
like in the next section.

164
00:09:40.168 --> 00:09:44.916
So any questions about this meta HTML?

165
00:09:44.916 --> 00:09:50.493
It's kind of, again,
nebulous because it's hard to visualize.

166
00:09:50.493 --> 00:09:54.014
So it's one of those things that
you just kinda have to do it and

167
00:09:54.014 --> 00:09:56.677
then forget that you do it,
and that's fine.

168
00:09:56.677 --> 00:10:00.563
[LAUGH] Cuz normally you don't
have to change it very much.

169
00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:03.659
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What does meta mean?

170
00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:04.607
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What does meta mean?

171
00:10:04.607 --> 00:10:05.582
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

172
00:10:09.937 --> 00:10:13.527
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do
I wanna explain that?

173
00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:14.538
That's a good question.

174
00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:22.518
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In this particular case I'm
not gonna define that cuz I'm probably not

175
00:10:22.518 --> 00:10:27.294
gonna get it right, but in this particular
case it means something that you're doing

176
00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:30.639
that's not necessarily going
to be displayed on the page.

177
00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:35.232
It's not necessarily going to have
an immediate concrete effect.

178
00:10:35.232 --> 00:10:39.852
So like if I change what the title is,
it's not going to change the way my

179
00:10:39.852 --> 00:10:43.087
page looks, but
it's still affecting my page and

180
00:10:43.087 --> 00:10:48.187
probably more subtle ways that changes
the way the page is like works, right?

181
00:10:48.187 --> 00:10:53.107
Like if I changed the DOCTYPE it would
change the way that the page was rendered,

182
00:10:53.107 --> 00:10:56.487
it would use another rendering
engine underneath it,

183
00:10:56.487 --> 00:11:00.767
which would change like how things
were laid out and what colors and.

184
00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:05.496
I don't know, things of that nature,
so they're more subtle changes.

185
00:11:05.496 --> 00:11:07.026
So it's a sufficiently vague answer.

186
00:11:07.026 --> 00:11:13.757
[LAUGH] It's kind of difficult to define,
but I mean, it's a good question.

187
00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:14.598
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

188
00:11:14.598 --> 00:11:15.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, of course.
