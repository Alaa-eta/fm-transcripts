00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.053
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So hopefully you've
absorbed a little bit about HTML and

2
00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:08.835
kind of what the uses are.

3
00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:12.643
I feel pretty good about where we are with
HTML and how much you've been taught and

4
00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:14.650
much you understand about it.

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.920
We're gonna have another just brief,
maybe ten-minute lesson,

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.720
kind of more about the meta level of HTML,
just kinda

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.970
like structure and kinda the boring parts
of it, if we're being completely honest.

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.870
And then we're gonna get into some
CSS which shall start, I think,

9
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.800
being a little bit more fun, I think.

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.092
Does anybody have any
questions before we get

11
00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:42.237
started?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

12
00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:45.020
obviously everything made perfect sense.

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.440
That's what I'm taking out of of this.

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.605
Cool, so we are on the Meta HTML section,

15
00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:56.379
section 6.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

16
00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.605
most of what I've been trying to show
you so far is visual and concrete and

17
00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:03.930
things that are a little bit more,
it's easy to see.

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530
If I change this, then I can see this.

19
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.520
What we're gonna do now is gonna
be a little bit more subtle

20
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.659
in how it affects your documents
that you're creating here.

21
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.050
So let's just start with the bare bones,
basic skeleton of an HTML document.

22
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.380
Right now everything we've
been doing has just kinda

23
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.280
been in the confines of these
little playgrounds, right?

24
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.830
But that's not usually how
you're writing code, right?

25
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.890
Normally you're in your editor and
you're creating like index.html and

26
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.250
it has a bunch of stuff, right?

27
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.870
And there's a certain amount of just
base layer stuff that you need.

28
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.130
The term for that is boilerplate.

29
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.099
Do not know why it's called boilerplate.

30
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.894
But when someone says boilerplate it means
just this repeated stuff that you just

31
00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:51.684
kind of always have to have, right?

32
00:01:51.684 --> 00:01:53.360
Basically it's what you copy and

33
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.510
paste from the last project to
get started on the next project.

34
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.670
Cuz we all do it, [LAUGH] and that's okay.

35
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.530
I do it every time I start a new project.

36
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.010
So this is right here that
I have these ten lines.

37
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.904
This is the base layer of what it
takes to have a basic HTML document.

38
00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:17.020
We're gonna dissect it line by line so
you understand what's going on.

39
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.634
So you can see all these
ten lines of code,

40
00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:24.622
all that comes out of
here is Check this out.

41
00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:26.590
That's it, it's the h1, right?

42
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.290
But let's talk about the rest of it here.

43
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.978
So the DOCTYPE html and the very,

44
00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:39.736
very first thing right here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I was talking

45
00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:40.410
about it before.

46
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.690
This is HTML 5.1 that
you're learning here.

47
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.230
HTML 5 has been out for
a decade, I'm gonna guess.

48
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.200
It's been out a decent amount of time.

49
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.930
It's to the point that HTML 5 is not
even a thing that we really say anymore,

50
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.040
it's just HTML now, right?

51
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.710
That's just kind of the base layer
assumption that everything is HTML now.

52
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.650
So the reason why we have
this thing right here

53
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.510
is we need to let the browser
know we're doing HTML 5.

54
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.610
We're doing the latest version of HTML and
that's what this thing right here,

55
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.040
the DOCTYPE, as it's called.

56
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.560
You can give it other DOCTYPE
headers to use older versions,

57
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.299
but I do not understand why you would
ever want to do that to yourself.

58
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.200
But there's strict HTML blah, blah, blah.

59
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.930
I can't remember what they are,
because it's been so

60
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.040
long since I've worked with it.

61
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.903
It's been literally since the beginning of
my first job that I've done anything else

62
00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:35.295
besides DOCTYPE HTML.

63
00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:37.890
And they look more or less all like this.

64
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.840
It does have to be literally
the first line of the code.

65
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.950
You can't even do a space here.

66
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.586
It has to be literally the first line.

67
00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:46.510
So that always should be there.

68
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.320
The next thing that you're gonna have is
this html tag that's closed down here.

69
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.410
That's just everything goes
inside of your html tag.

70
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.290
That's just like the way that works.

71
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.050
It's letting you know the beginning and
the ending of your doc.

72
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.810
And then it's gonna have this lang="en".

73
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.625
en, as you may have guessed,
stands for English.

74
00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:18.477
And you're just letting the browser know,
hey, I'm sending an English document down.

75
00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:21.510
You can put es there
which would be Spanish.

76
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.730
You would send whatever language
you're putting that in there so

77
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.640
that the browser knows, cool,
you're about to receive Japanese.

78
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.970
Be prepared to receive Japanese,
that kind of stuff, right?

79
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.720
Also just kinda as a side note, your
browser has a language that's set for it.

80
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.880
I downloaded this browser in America, it
just assumes that I wanna speak English.

81
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.810
And it assumes that I will change
it if I don't wanna speak English.

82
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.440
So my browser is actually requesting
English from wherever website I go to,

83
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.810
and then it's receiving English back.

84
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.390
So that's done through headers, which we
will talk about headers in a little bit.

85
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.550
But basically it's meta information
that I'm sending from my browser saying,

86
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.760
hey, do you have any English documents?

87
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.870
And then it sends back with this and
says, yes, here is your English document.

88
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.380
So again, we'll get more into
headers later in the course.

89
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.950
So that's what the html lang= that.

90
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.183
Okay, we're gonna talk about head here for
a second which is this one right here.

91
00:05:25.183 --> 00:05:29.070
Now keep in mind that there is a header
and a head and they are different.

92
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.380
So we're talking about head at this
moment in time, just so you know.

93
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.119
Every HTML document has a head and
it has a body.

94
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.800
And in the head goes all the meta
information about your document.

95
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.480
So in this particular case,
we're just putting the title.

96
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.700
And the title is if you Google something,
and let's just Google something.

97
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.970
If I Google Frontend Masters, so

98
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.370
this part right here is
what's in their title, right?

99
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.190
So it's the title of the document.

100
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.680
That's what goes in title.

101
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.130
It's also if I click on this,
notice when I click on it,

102
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.820
it's gonna be what's up here in the tab.

103
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.020
So it's also what goes right there, right?

104
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.543
That is the title.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's weird,

105
00:06:23.543 --> 00:06:24.683
I've been watching myself.

106
00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:29.802
[LAUGH] Okay, so
that's what the title goes in there.

107
00:06:29.802 --> 00:06:32.370
You should call it whatever
the name of the document is.

108
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.328
This one's called Intro to Web Dev V2.

109
00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:35.240
That make sense?

110
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.740
So that when someone navigates
to another tab, he's like, okay,

111
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.990
there's my Web Dev document.

112
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.606
I'm just gonna click back on that one.

113
00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:43.200
So that should always be there.

114
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.930
There are lots of other
things that can go in head.

115
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.540
You can configure the viewport,
for example.

116
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.110
So the viewport is,
how do I wanna explain that?

117
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.530
If I'm on a mobile phone,
do I want the website to shrink

118
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.030
to the size of the phone or
do I want to continue so

119
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.530
they have to scroll side to
side to see the whole thing?

120
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.440
You can configure those sorts
of thing inside of the head.

121
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.640
It's just the meta information that
the user doesn't necessarily see but

122
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.800
still needs to be configured.

123
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.860
That stuff all goes in head.

124
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.130
All of your CSS links all
go in the head as well.

125
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.610
There's some other things as well.

126
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.190
So basically if it's a thing
that's not shown to the user but

127
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.400
it's used to configure your website,
those sorts of things go in the head.

128
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.925
Any questions about head?

129
00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:41.254
It's kind of nebulous, I know.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

130
00:07:43.554 --> 00:07:44.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the things that go

131
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.450
in body is what we've been writing so far.

132
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.490
It's all your divs,
spans, etc., etc., right?

133
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.910
All that stuff is gonna
go inside your body.

134
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.950
That's the stuff that
people are going to see.

135
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.570
So that's where our h1 went.

136
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.535
I put a comment in there, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

137
00:08:02.535 --> 00:08:06.531
then that is like, this is the bare
minimum stuff they need to run

138
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:11.183
a website.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's actually a couple

139
00:08:11.183 --> 00:08:15.000
other things that probably should be in
there, but we're kind of ignoring for now,

140
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.491
which is okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

141
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:28.490
so last thing I wanna talk about
are script, style and link.

142
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.200
So script is how you link
JavaScript files into your HTML.

143
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.720
Cuz your HTML and your JavaScript
files are gonna be separate files.

144
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.150
You're not gonna put them together,
you're gonna separate them, and

145
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.590
believe me it's gonna end up being better.

146
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.110
So that's gonna be linked
in via script tag.

147
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.650
It's the same thing with link.

148
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.570
Link is how you bring in all of your CSS.

149
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.740
And again, your CSS is gonna
live in a different file and

150
00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.710
you're going to be
brought in via link tag.

151
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.850
Today we're gonna be using a lot of style
tags, just because I want you to be able

152
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.430
to see your HTML and your CSS at
the same time and be able to edit them.

153
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.439
That's not typically how
you're gonna do things.

154
00:09:11.439 --> 00:09:14.695
You're typically gonna have a link tag
with a separate CSS file that's gonna be

155
00:09:14.695 --> 00:09:15.960
brought in.

156
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:21.280
But just for today, just for demonstration
purposes, we'll be using style tags.

157
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.653
So we'll get more into that when
we kind of get there, but just so

158
00:09:24.653 --> 00:09:28.910
you know this is atypical, you definitely
do not wanna use style tags normally.

159
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.082
So what style tag is,

160
00:09:32.082 --> 00:09:36.869
you can actually put CSS inside of
the style tag and it will work.

161
00:09:36.869 --> 00:09:38.940
We'll see what that looks
like in the next section.

162
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.540
So any questions about
kind of this meta HTML?

163
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.408
It's kind of, again,
nebulous because it's hard to visualize.

164
00:09:49.408 --> 00:09:55.050
[LAUGH] So it's one of those things
that you just kinda have to do it.

165
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.698
And then you forgot that you do it,
and that's fine.

166
00:09:56.698 --> 00:10:00.837
[LAUGH] Cuz normally you don't
have to change it very much.

167
00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:03.551
&gt;&gt; Student: What does meta mean?

168
00:10:03.551 --> 00:10:04.462
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What does meta mean?

169
00:10:04.462 --> 00:10:05.224
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.

170
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:12.517
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do I wanna explain

171
00:10:12.517 --> 00:10:13.405
that?

172
00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:19.527
It's a good question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In this particular case,

173
00:10:19.527 --> 00:10:22.410
I'm not gonna define meta cuz I'm
probably not gonna get it right.

174
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.247
But in this particular case, it means
something that you are doing that's

175
00:10:27.247 --> 00:10:30.571
not necessarily going to
be displayed on the page.

176
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:35.471
It's not necessarily going to have
like an immediate concrete effect.

177
00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:40.448
If I change the title, it's not gonna
change the way that my page looks.

178
00:10:40.448 --> 00:10:45.470
But it's still affecting my page
in probably more subtle ways.

179
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.699
It changes the way the pages work.

180
00:10:47.699 --> 00:10:52.850
So if I changed the DOCTYPE, it would
change the way that the page was rendered.

181
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.305
It would use a different rendering
engine underneath it, which would change

182
00:10:57.305 --> 00:11:02.303
how things were laid out, and what colors,
and I don't know, things of that nature,

183
00:11:02.303 --> 00:11:06.313
so they're more subtle changes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is that a sufficiently

184
00:11:06.313 --> 00:11:06.931
vague answer?

185
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:11.689
[LAUGH] It's kind of difficult to define,
but I mean,

186
00:11:11.689 --> 00:11:15.090
it's a good question.
&gt;&gt; Student: Thank you.

187
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, of course.
