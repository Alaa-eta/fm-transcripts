00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Overview of what you'll be

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.511
learning in this course.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A large part of

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:09.640
what you're gonna be learning
today is just terminology.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.730
And I'm trying to strip away
the ones that you don't need.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.990
There's some in here like monads and
functors.

6
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.339
And I know someone online is gonna be
super pissed off that I'm making fun of

7
00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.429
functional programming, but I don't care.

8
00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.367
I'm sure I've already
pissed them off before.

9
00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.212
There's stuff like that
you can just ignore.

10
00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:31.713
It's just high and mighty computer science
terminology that actually is not gonna

11
00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:33.714
serve you too much in your day to day.

12
00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:37.837
What I'm trying to distill this down to is
words that you need today to be able to

13
00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.839
search for the answers that you need.

14
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.930
So that's why you're gonna need to
know things like HTML tags, and

15
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.160
functions and scope.

16
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.170
Because that actually is gonna serve
you really well when you're trying to

17
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.940
solve a problem.

18
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.145
And that's a big problem with
computer science in general is people

19
00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:56.890
wanna use the most
technically accurate term.

20
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.550
There's a framework called Angular
that's quite well known for

21
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.264
this that they use things like
transclusion, which is like, yes,

22
00:01:06.264 --> 00:01:08.555
that perfectly describes
what they're doing.

23
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:11.420
But most people don't actually
understand what that means,

24
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.960
which means it's worthless to me.

25
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.410
So I'm trying to not use terms like that,
and

26
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.540
I'm trying to give you the best terms
to be able to solve your problems.

27
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.880
But again,
if I use a term that you don't understand,

28
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.680
I guarantee you that someone
else doesn't understand.

29
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.655
And so you should definitely stop me and

30
00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:34.237
ask about it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's see, a good litmus

31
00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:38.120
test of if you should understand the term,
like if you should spend the time.

32
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.050
If you repeatedly hear it
in whatever you're doing,

33
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.540
you should probably look it up.

34
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.190
But if you see a term that you don't
understand, at least the first or

35
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.840
second time,
you can probably just ignore and move on.

36
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.901
At least, that's how I handle it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something else,

37
00:01:54.901 --> 00:02:00.023
you're gonna have to learn three
languages today, which is cool, I think.

38
00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:04.318
[LAUGH] It's like going into your
language class, it's like, by the way,

39
00:02:04.318 --> 00:02:08.561
you're gonna learn Japanese, German and
Italian today, so buckle up.

40
00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:12.331
[LAUGH] Hopefully it's
a little easier than that, but

41
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:15.699
we're gonna learn HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.

42
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.748
Luckily, two of those
are kind of considered,

43
00:02:19.748 --> 00:02:22.188
they're not programming languages.

44
00:02:22.188 --> 00:02:26.450
Because they don't actually execute,
they don't run.

45
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.370
You can think of them more like English,

46
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.250
that they're declarative in the sense
that you kinda state what you mean.

47
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.960
And it's like English, right, you can't
run English, you just say English, right?

48
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.090
And that's what HTML and CSS are,
they're not run languages.

49
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.570
You're stating something,

50
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.470
and then a computer later is
interpreting what you stated, right?

51
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.100
Whereas JavaScript is
actually a full-fledged

52
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.900
programming language that you run.

53
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.686
You run JavaScript, right?

54
00:02:54.686 --> 00:02:59.270
If that doesn't make total sense right
now, when we kinda get into those,

55
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.957
hopefully that'll make a bit more sense.

56
00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:02.460
But just know that HTML and

57
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.060
CSS are declared languages where
you're just stating something,

58
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.880
whereas JavaScript you're telling
the computer to do something.

59
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.280
Okay, and then we'll also go over
the command line and how to use Git.

60
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.410
And we'll talk about that when we get
there, that'll definitely be tomorrow.

61
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.881
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure I covered

62
00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:33.280
everything I wanted to talk about.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I wanna make an analogy.

63
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.530
And I'm gonna reference this
analogy a lot during this course.

64
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.258
And that's the analogy of building

65
00:03:39.258 --> 00:03:44.095
a house.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you're thinking about

66
00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:48.538
your website is a house,
then we can kind of use HTML, CSS and

67
00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:53.390
JavaScript to kind of describe
the various parts of it.

68
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.650
So you can think of HTML as
the raw building material.

69
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.120
It's the drywall, it's the 2x4s,
it's the frame of the house, right?

70
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.865
In and of itself,
if I just take a bunch of lumber to a lot,

71
00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:10.080
then just leave it there,
it's not a very good house.

72
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.300
Despite the fact that you have
everything to make a house,

73
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.990
you need to make the house.

74
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.460
You can't just leave
the building materials there and

75
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.603
expect it to be a website.

76
00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:23.055
So that's kinda what HTML is.

77
00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:26.776
It's all the raw building materials,
and then you're gonna use CSS and

78
00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:29.159
JavaScript to kind of
put the house together.

79
00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.560
So think of HTML as the raw
building materials.

80
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.742
You can think of CSS more as
like blueprints for the house.

81
00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.834
It's a bunch of rules that
you use to describe where you

82
00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:40.406
want things to go, right?

83
00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:43.800
So I want this 2x4 to
go on the south wall,

84
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.420
I want this one to go on the north wall.

85
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.390
I want these ones to go on the roof and
things like that.

86
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.460
It's a bunch of rules that describe what
you want the house to be organized as,

87
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.900
and what you want the colors to be and
those sorts of things.

88
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.250
So the CSS is the blueprints of the house.

89
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.612
It's where everything's laid out,

90
00:05:02.612 --> 00:05:08.028
it's where everything goes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's both the layout and

91
00:05:08.028 --> 00:05:11.914
the style, so it's like what
wallpaper is gonna go on the walls.

92
00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:17.280
It's gonna be those sorts of things,
so it's the stylistic presentation

93
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.479
of your website is what CSS does.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

94
00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.390
then lastly, so
you have the whole house together.

95
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.152
You can actually just stop
there with HTML and CSS.

96
00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:33.423
If your website doesn't have
any really interaction with it,

97
00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:37.002
like if you're just like making like
a website that describes events

98
00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:39.303
happening at your local community center.

99
00:05:39.303 --> 00:05:40.058
There's not really much
interaction with that.

100
00:05:40.058 --> 00:05:45.145
It's basically like a flyer
that you've put online,

101
00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:49.686
or a PDF that you've just
put up on the internet.

102
00:05:49.686 --> 00:05:53.564
You can stop there, HTML and
CSS is enough to make just that.

103
00:05:53.564 --> 00:05:57.841
However, if you want anything to
be interactive with your website,

104
00:05:57.841 --> 00:05:59.252
you need JavaScript.

105
00:05:59.252 --> 00:06:02.247
That's the porgramming
language of the web.

106
00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:06.370
And I will kind of make the analogy of
that to being like a smart house, right?

107
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.707
What if you wanted to drive
your car into your driveway,

108
00:06:09.707 --> 00:06:12.910
have the garage door open and
the thermostat turn on.

109
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.915
And it makes you a cup of coffee,
I don't know, something like that.

110
00:06:16.915 --> 00:06:21.761
You would make a bunch of programmatic
things, like if this happens then do this,

111
00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:23.813
and do this, and do this, right?

112
00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:28.592
Once I do this thing, a bunch of
other things should happen, right?

113
00:06:28.592 --> 00:06:31.306
That's kinda like
the smart house mentality.

114
00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:34.450
And that's kinda what JavaScript does for
you.

115
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.290
You're kind of making your
website reactive, right?

116
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.730
So if the user clicks this button,
then send this request over here, and

117
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.290
show him this dialogue.

118
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.130
And gather this information from them and
show them this image, right.

119
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.400
So it's kind of all these kind of
interactions that are happening.

120
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.044
And that's what JavaScript
is gonna buy for

121
00:06:53.044 --> 00:06:57.518
you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

122
00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:04.716
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yes, you can

123
00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.221
make a website with zero JavaScript.

124
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:10.667
However, most sites on the web now,
almost everything is using JavaScript.

125
00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:16.764
So you don't necessarily have
to have a smart home, right?

126
00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:20.097
But these days, almost everything
does have JavaScript on it.

127
00:07:20.097 --> 00:07:23.511
So it is more common
than being a smart home.

128
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:28.718
Lastly, we're gonna talk a little
bit about servers at the end.

129
00:07:28.718 --> 00:07:32.670
We're gonna work with
something called Node.js,

130
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.810
which is a server side
programming using JavaScript.

131
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.220
So, some of you might have heard of
things like Python, or Ruby, or Java,

132
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.610
or Go or C#.

133
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.786
These are languages that you
are going to write on the server.

134
00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:48.445
We're not gonna learn any of those things,
one,

135
00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:51.660
cuz you definitely don't wanna
learn those things from me.

136
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.539
And two, this is Frontend Masters,
so we're gonna work with JavaScript.

137
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.980
And the nice thing about working with
Node is Node is still JavaScript.

138
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.960
So we're going to be running
JavaScript inside of your browser,

139
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.550
which is the client-side code.

140
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.294
That's the smart home kind of stuff.

141
00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:08.770
And then we're also going to
be running it on the server.

142
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.580
And you can think of the server like
the pizza place in your neighborhood.

143
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.460
So you have a bunch of different houses,
a bunch of different

144
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.310
people that are browsing your website all
calling into the one pizza place, right.

145
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.830
So one server serves multiple clients or

146
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.524
multiple browsers and phones,
and things like that, right?

147
00:08:28.524 --> 00:08:33.280
And then you think when you want a pizza,
you pick up your phone.

148
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.560
You call them, you ask for something,
and then they send you something, right?

149
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.790
That's kind of the request response

150
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.510
cycle of what it's like to
interact with a server.

151
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.670
So that's kinda what the pizza place is.

152
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.160
So to recap here, I just wrote it
down if you missed some of that.

153
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.380
HTML is the structure,
it's going to contain all the text,

154
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.790
the images,
kinda just the raw content, right.

155
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.640
Mostly it's gonna be text,
text and structuring.

156
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.280
The CSS is the blueprint, this is gonna be
where everything goes, what color it is,

157
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.300
what size it is, what font it is,
what the decorative background images are.

158
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.070
And like HTML,
CSS doesn't do anything itself, right?

159
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.200
You're not going to be
executing anything with CSS,

160
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.586
you're just going to be
describing what you want.

161
00:09:27.586 --> 00:09:31.390
Then the front-end JavaScript,

162
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.776
which is the JavaScript that's
run inside of the browser.

163
00:09:33.776 --> 00:09:39.070
It's the smart home stuff, that's gonna

164
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.640
be if they click this, then show them
this dialogue, or download this image.

165
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.530
Or if they scroll down far enough in their
Instagram feed that we're gonna load more

166
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.460
images at the bottom.

167
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.730
That's gonna be the kinda stuff
that JavaScript is gonna do for

168
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.399
you on the client.

169
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:59.050
And then the back-end code,
which is the pizza place,

170
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.700
someone's going to request more images
to show someone in their Instagram feed.

171
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.610
So the pizza place is gonna go in,
it's gonna find everything that the user

172
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.580
asks for, and
then it's going to give that back to them.

173
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.040
So that's gonna be,
reading from databases,

174
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.670
it's going to be doing
server-side calculations.

175
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.621
Anything that you would need to
centralize into your server,

176
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:20.990
that's gonna go into that.

177
00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:25.250
And one server is going to
serve many clients just like

178
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.540
one pizza place serves many households.

179
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.924
Any questions about that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, please.

180
00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:35.493
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So I don't understand,

181
00:10:35.493 --> 00:10:40.962
why haven't we taken HTML and CSS, even
though they're created at different times?

182
00:10:40.962 --> 00:10:44.470
Why don't we meld them both
in the JavaScript, and

183
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.735
then just use JavaScript for everything?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question,

184
00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:51.590
why don't we just use JavaScript for
anything?

185
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.010
It's a lively debate that we could have.

186
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.660
So there are people doing that, actually.

187
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.370
In fact, one of my other courses,

188
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.260
which is Complete Intro to React,
React more or less achieves that.

189
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.162
It uses JavaScript to generate HTML,
which is something very common to do,

190
00:11:11.162 --> 00:11:14.710
especially with a modern
day kind of infrastructure.

191
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.530
But right now, it's actually really
important for you to understand

192
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.500
the primitives that it generates,
so the HTML that it does generate.

193
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.370
It's gonna make you a better programmer.

194
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.698
But eventually,
I'm not gonna say it's better, but

195
00:11:29.698 --> 00:11:33.591
there are people doing it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know if I have

196
00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:34.402
a better answer than that.

197
00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:41.130
Okay, [LAUGH] that's a good question.

198
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.142
Anyone else?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

199
00:11:47.104 --> 00:11:48.786
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, a note about this

200
00:11:48.786 --> 00:11:51.220
course's website.

201
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.040
If you see a code sample like this, and

202
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.960
it's on a yellow background,
that's kind of probably hard to see.

203
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.310
But I promise you that is kind of
a light yellow background there.

204
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.780
This code is not editable, but
if you see something like this,

205
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.580
this code is editable,
editable, it's hard to say.

206
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.740
So if I put This is super cool, you'll see

207
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:21.977
it actually being used down here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I really

208
00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:26.613
hope that as you're following along,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That

209
00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:29.983
you are messing with these,
that you're breaking them,

210
00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:33.922
that you're unbreaking them and
discovering and playing with it.

211
00:12:33.922 --> 00:12:37.399
Cuz I think that's gonna
really help instruct you.

212
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.566
And help you understand that if I
make this an h5 instead of an h1,

213
00:12:43.566 --> 00:12:45.970
it makes it look different, and

214
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.837
things like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

215
00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:54.505
I spent a bunch of time making this work,
so you better use it.

216
00:12:54.505 --> 00:13:03.248
[LAUGH] That's the sum of my story.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The one

217
00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:08.589
thing that I will say is that if you
write something that breaks in here,

218
00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:13.590
and it breaks really badly,
it might actually crash the web page.

219
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.293
So just refresh the page, so
that is something that you can do.

220
00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:18.334
And if you do reresh the page,

221
00:13:18.334 --> 00:13:20.263
it's going to reset everything
back to the way it was.

222
00:13:20.263 --> 00:13:23.894
So if you find some code that you're
really happy with and you wanna keep,

223
00:13:23.894 --> 00:13:27.658
you should just copy and paste it into
a separate file that you're keeping.

224
00:13:27.658 --> 00:13:35.553
So that would be a good idea as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

225
00:13:38.514 --> 00:13:42.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

226
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So earlier when you said

227
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:50.420
the lighter color we cannot edit it,
is it because of the lighter of the color,

228
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.750
or is it the background that
make it you can't edit it?

229
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, that's a good question.

230
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.850
I made it look different, so
that you can tell that you can't edit it.

231
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.960
And I did it on purpose, because some
of these things if you edit them,

232
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.790
you will definitely crash the web page.

233
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.950
[LAUGH] So, it's to protect you from
yourself, or protect you from me.

234
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.260
I think it's probably more accurate.

235
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.510
[LAUGH]
So

236
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.180
there's no necessarily technical reason.

237
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.840
It was a reason that I chose
to make it not editable.

238
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.065
Does that answer your question?

239
00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:26.438
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyone else?

240
00:14:28.724 --> 00:14:30.245
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Someone was asking,

241
00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:35.026
inside that, what is that code
that you're just editing?

242
00:14:35.026 --> 00:14:36.843
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're about to find out,

243
00:14:36.843 --> 00:14:38.910
good question, what is that?

244
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.869
I will tell you very soon.

245
00:14:42.869 --> 00:14:45.720
And I'm being cheeky
by saying it that way.

246
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.063
But there's a very deliberate order that
these things kind of build together.

247
00:14:50.063 --> 00:14:54.657
And so if you go on too many diatribes too
early, we're gonna get off track a and

248
00:14:54.657 --> 00:14:56.199
there is a lot of content.

249
00:14:56.199 --> 00:15:01.610
Just so you know, it's insane to try and
learn web development in two days.

250
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.789
It is just a ton of content, right?

251
00:15:02.789 --> 00:15:07.771
So, you're gonna kinda have
the firehose pointed at you, and

252
00:15:07.771 --> 00:15:11.155
sorry, not sorry, a little bit, right?

253
00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:16.142
[LAUGH] A lot of this is to expose these
things to you so you, kind of like,

254
00:15:16.142 --> 00:15:20.549
understand the things that you
don't understand and this is,

255
00:15:20.549 --> 00:15:23.930
kind of,
a theory that I have a little bit.

256
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.137
You have these.

257
00:15:25.137 --> 00:15:28.692
You have what you don't know that you
don't know, and you can't Google, or you

258
00:15:28.692 --> 00:15:32.481
can't talk about the things that you don't
know that you don't know about, right?

259
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:35.302
But as soon as these things enter
into this realm that you like,

260
00:15:35.302 --> 00:15:38.191
I know these things exist, and so
when I go to try and use Is that.

261
00:15:38.191 --> 00:15:41.828
I was like, I don't know how to use it
right now, but I know how to Google it.

262
00:15:41.828 --> 00:15:43.754
[LAUGH] And
I think that's really important.

263
00:15:43.754 --> 00:15:47.391
So that's kinda like a big point of this
is to introduce you to these things.

264
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:50.793
I don't expect you to walk away
understanding all these things 100%.

265
00:15:50.793 --> 00:15:55.252
What I expect you to be able to do is that
you would be able to if you If you needed

266
00:15:55.252 --> 00:15:56.610
to do that, right?

267
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.440
So I'm exposing you to these concepts so

268
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.240
that you can learn them
more deeply as necessary.

269
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.710
Hopefully that makes some sense.

270
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.840
So, if I kinda like say,
I'm not gonna answer that right now,

271
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.700
that's the reason why I'm doing it, is so

272
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.290
that I can come back later in the course
and teach you some of these things.

273
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:21.870
The other thing is that A lot of these,
I'm covering this broad range of topics.

274
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.340
And what's nice about Frontend Masters
is they have a lot of

275
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.350
dpeth into each one of these.

276
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.520
So for example, we're gonna just
scratch the surface of Git, but

277
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.060
if you wanna deep dive
into Git there's and

278
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.370
avanced Git course on her by
Nina Zakharenko that is really good.

279
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.650
So you can check that out later.
