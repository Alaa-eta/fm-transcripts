00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.028
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Overview of what
you'll be learning in this course.

2
00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:07.014
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A large part of what you're

3
00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:09.640
gonna be learning today
is just terminology.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.070
And I'm trying to like strip away
like the ones that you don't need.

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.521
There's some in here,
like monads and functors.

6
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:20.122
And I know someone online is gonna be
super pissed off that I'm making fun of

7
00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.680
functional programming,
but I don't care [LAUGH].

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.110
I'm sure I've already
pissed him off before.

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.490
There's stuff like that
you can just ignore,

10
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.800
it's just high and mighty computer
science terminology that actually

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.030
is not gonna serve you too
much in your day to day.

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.770
What I'm trying to distill this down into
is words that you need today to be able to

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830
search for the answers that you need.

14
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.532
So that's why you're gonna need to know
things like HTML tags, and functions, and

15
00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:49.930
scope, because that actually is gonna
serve you really well when you're trying

16
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.045
to solve a problem.

17
00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:53.934
And that's a big problem with
computer science in general,

18
00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:56.890
is people wanna use like the most
technically accurate term.

19
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.710
There's a framework called Angular,
that's quite well-known for this,

20
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.260
that they use things like
transclusion which is like, yes,

21
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.780
that perfectly describes
what they're doing.

22
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.420
But most people don't actually
understand what that means,

23
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.960
which means it's worthless to me.

24
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.410
So, I'm trying to not use terms like that,
and

25
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.540
I'm trying to give you the best terms
to be able to solve your problems.

26
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.632
But again, if I use a term that you don't
understand, I guarantee you that someone

27
00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:27.965
else doesn't understand, and so
you should definitely stop me and

28
00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:32.472
ask about it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, let's see a good Litmus

29
00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:38.120
test, if you should understand the term,
like if you should spend the time.

30
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.050
If you repeatedly hear it
in whatever you're doing,

31
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.540
you should probably look it up.

32
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.190
But if you see a term that you don't
understand, at least the first or

33
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.850
second time, you can probably
just ignore it and move on.

34
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.832
At least that's how I handle it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something else,

35
00:01:54.832 --> 00:01:58.177
you're gonna have to learn
three languages today.

36
00:01:58.177 --> 00:02:01.470
Which is cool, I think [LAUGH].

37
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.670
It's like going into your language class.

38
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.041
It's like, by the way, you're gonna learn
Japanese, German and Italian today.

39
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:09.430
So, buckle up [LAUGH].

40
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.840
Hopefully, it's a little
bit easier than that.

41
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.027
But we're gonna learn HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

42
00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:21.900
Luckily, two of those are kind of
considered, they're not programming

43
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.468
languages because they don't
actually execute, they don't run.

44
00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:28.952
You can think of them more like English,

45
00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:34.250
that they're declarative in the sense
that you kinda state what you mean.

46
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.530
And it's like English, right?

47
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.960
You can't run English,
you just say English, right?

48
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.530
And that's what HTML and CSS are,
they're not run languages,

49
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.660
they are just,
you're stating something, and

50
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.470
then a computer later is
interpreting what you stated, right?

51
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.520
Whereas JavaScript is actually a
full-fledged programming language that you

52
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.680
run, you run JavaScript, right?

53
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.424
If that doesn't make total sense right
now, well, let me kinda get into those.

54
00:02:59.424 --> 00:03:03.265
Hopefully, that will make a bit more
sense, but just know that HTML and

55
00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:07.060
CSS are declared languages,
where you're just stating something.

56
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.779
Whereas, JavaScript, you're telling
the computer to do something.

57
00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:13.145
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, and

58
00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:18.530
then we'll also go over the command line,
and how to use git.

59
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.033
And we'll talk about that when we get
there, that will definitely be tomorrow.

60
00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:27.023
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure I cover

61
00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:33.365
everything I wanted to talk about.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I wanna make an analogy,

62
00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:36.530
and I'm gonna reference this
analogy a lot during this course.

63
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.900
And that's the analogy
of building a house.

64
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.460
If you're thinking that your
website is a house, right?

65
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.004
Then we can kind of use HTML, CSS and

66
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:53.390
JavaScript to kind of describe
the various parts of it.

67
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.135
So you can think of HTML as like the raw
building materials, the drive walls,

68
00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:01.867
it's the two by four,
it's the frame of the house, right?

69
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:06.457
In of itself, if I just like take
a bunch of lumber to like a lot and

70
00:04:06.457 --> 00:04:10.030
just leave it there,
it's not a very good house.

71
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.300
Despite the fact that you have
everything to make a house,

72
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.990
you need to make the house, right?

73
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.360
You can't just leave the building
materials there, and

74
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.734
expect it to be like a website.

75
00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:25.100
So that's kind of what HTML is,
it's all the raw building materials.

76
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.760
And then you're gonna use CSS and

77
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.440
JavaScript to kind of
put the house together.

78
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.390
So think of HTML as the raw
building materials.

79
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.020
You can think of CSS more as
like blueprints for the house.

80
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.310
It's a bunch of rules that you
use to describe where you want

81
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.690
things to go, right?

82
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.800
So I want this two by four
to go on the south wall,

83
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.420
I want this one to go on the north wall,

84
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.260
I want you know these ones to go on
like the roof and things like that.

85
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.776
So, it's a bunch of rules that describe
what you want the house to be organized

86
00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:58.728
as, and like what we want the colors
to be, and those sorts of things.

87
00:04:58.728 --> 00:05:02.309
So the CSS is the blueprints of the house,
it's where everything's laid out,

88
00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:07.897
it's where everything goes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's both the layout and

89
00:05:07.897 --> 00:05:11.450
the style, so it's like what
wallpaper is gonna go on the walls.

90
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.266
It's gonna be those sorts of things,
so it's the stylist presentation of

91
00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:22.784
your website is what CSS does.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

92
00:05:22.784 --> 00:05:26.390
then lastly, so
you have the whole house together.

93
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.329
You can actually just stop
there with HTML and CSS.

94
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.540
If your website doesn't have
any really interaction with it.

95
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.718
If you're just making a website to
describe like events happening,

96
00:05:36.718 --> 00:05:39.032
like your local communities center.

97
00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:41.208
There's not really much
interaction with that,

98
00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:43.970
it's basically like a flyer that
ou put online [LAUGH], right?

99
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.560
Or PDF, right?

100
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.190
That you've just put on the internet.

101
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.650
You can't stop there,
like HTML CSS is enough to make just that.

102
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.110
However, if you want anything to
be interactive with your website,

103
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.260
you need JavaScript.

104
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.140
That's the programming
language of the web.

105
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.470
And that would kind of make the analogy
of that to be like a smart house, right?

106
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.686
Like what if you wanted to drive your car
into your driveway, have the garage door

107
00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:14.233
open, and the thermostat turn on,
and it makes you a cup of coffee.

108
00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:16.964
I don't know,
something like that, all right?

109
00:06:16.964 --> 00:06:21.437
You would make like a bunch of like
programmatic things, like if this happens,

110
00:06:21.437 --> 00:06:24.199
then do this, and do this,
and do this, right?

111
00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:29.580
Like once I do this thing, a bunch of
other things should happen, right?

112
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.580
That's kind of like
the smart house mentality.

113
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.500
And that's kind of what
JavaScript does for you.

114
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.302
You kind of making your website reactive,
right?

115
00:06:37.302 --> 00:06:42.210
So if the users clicks this button, then
send this request over here, and show them

116
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.130
this dialog, and gather this information
for them, and show them this image, right?

117
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.400
So it's kind of all these kind of
interactions that are happening.

118
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.028
And that's what JavaScript
is gonna buy for

119
00:06:53.028 --> 00:06:58.225
you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

120
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yes,

121
00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:07.750
you can make a website
with zero JavaScript.

122
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.100
However, most sites on the web now,
almost everything is using JavaScript.

123
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.281
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't have to

124
00:07:15.281 --> 00:07:17.250
necessarily have to have a smart home,
right?

125
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.990
But these days, it's almost everything
does have JavaScript on them.

126
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.510
So, it is more common
than being a smart home.

127
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.070
Lastly, we're gonna talk a little
bit about servers at the end.

128
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.900
We're gonna work with something called,
Node JS,

129
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.810
which is a server side
programming using JavaScript.

130
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.010
So, some of you might've heard of things
like Python, or Ruby, or Java, or Go, or

131
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.610
CSharp.

132
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.770
These are languages that you're
going to write on the server.

133
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.032
We're not gonna learn any of those things.

134
00:07:48.032 --> 00:07:51.660
One, cuz you definitely don't want to
learn those things from me [LAUGH].

135
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.539
And two, this is for the masters, so
we're gonna work with JavaScript.

136
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.980
And the nice thing about working with
Node, is Node is still JavaScript.

137
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.960
So we're going to be running
JavaScript inside of your browser,

138
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.550
which is like the client side code.

139
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.400
That's the smart home kind of stuff.

140
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.770
And then we're also going to
be running it on the server.

141
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.580
And you can think of the server like
the pizza place in your neighborhood.

142
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.460
So you have a bunch of different houses,
right, a bunch of different

143
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.310
people that are browsing your website, all
calling into the one pizza place, right?

144
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.870
So one server serves multiple clients,
or multiple browsers,

145
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.500
and phones, and things like that, right?

146
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.280
And you think with like when you want
a pizza, you pick up your phone.

147
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.560
You call them, you ask for something,
and then they send you something, right?

148
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.460
That's kind of the request response
cycle of what it's like to order,

149
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.510
to interact with the server.

150
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.670
So, that's kind of what
the pizza place is.

151
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.980
So to recap here, I just wrote it down.

152
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.560
If you were missing some of that,
HTML is the structure.

153
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.980
It's gonna contain all the text,
the images,

154
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.988
kinda just like the raw content, right?

155
00:09:02.988 --> 00:09:08.232
Mostly it's gonna be text,
text and structuring.

156
00:09:08.232 --> 00:09:14.483
The CSS the blueprint, this is gonna be
where everything goes, what color it is,

157
00:09:14.483 --> 00:09:19.570
what size it is, what font it is,
what the decorative images are.

158
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.885
And like HTML CSS doesn't do
anything in of itself, right?

159
00:09:22.885 --> 00:09:26.336
You're not going to be
executing anything with CSS,

160
00:09:26.336 --> 00:09:29.643
you're just going to be
describing what you want.

161
00:09:29.643 --> 00:09:31.211
Then the front-end JavaScript,

162
00:09:31.211 --> 00:09:33.760
which is the JavaScript that
run inside of the browser.

163
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.397
It's the smart home stuff.

164
00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:42.220
That's gonna be, if they click this,
then show them this dialog,

165
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.640
or show them this image.

166
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.540
Or if they scroll down far
enough in their Instagram feed,

167
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.360
that we're gonna load more images at
the bottom, that's going to be the kind of

168
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.399
stuff that JavaScript is going to do for
you and the client.

169
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:59.050
And then the backend code, which is
the pizza place, that's going to be,

170
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.700
someone's going to request more images
to show someone in their Instagram feed.

171
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.861
So, the pizza place is gonna go in, it's
gonna find everything that the user asked

172
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:10.492
for, and
then it's going to give that back to them.

173
00:10:10.492 --> 00:10:13.272
So that's gonna be reading from databases,

174
00:10:13.272 --> 00:10:16.500
it's going to be doing
service like calculations.

175
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.550
Like anything that you would need
to centralize into your server,

176
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.990
that's gonna go into that.

177
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.303
When in one service, it's gonna serve
many clients just like one pizza place

178
00:10:26.303 --> 00:10:31.105
serves many household.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

179
00:10:33.261 --> 00:10:33.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, please.

180
00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:35.838
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Still don't understand why

181
00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:41.380
haven't we taken HTML and CSS, even though
they were created at different times.

182
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.515
Why don't we meld them both
in the JavaScript, and

183
00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:48.790
then just use JavaScript for everything?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

184
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.470
Why don't we just use JavaScript for
anything.

185
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.010
That's a lively debate that we could have.

186
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.660
So, there are people doing that, actually.

187
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.370
In fact, one of my other courses,

188
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.260
which is Complete Intro to React,
React more or less achieves that.

189
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.500
It uses JavaScript to generate HTML,
which is something very common to do,

190
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.710
especially with a modern
day kind of infrastructure.

191
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.530
But, right now, it's actually really
important for you to understand

192
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.500
the primitives that it generates,
so the HTML that it does generate.

193
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.370
It's gonna make you a better programmer.

194
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:32.746
But eventually, I'm not gonna say it's
better, but there are people doing it.

195
00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:36.750
I don't know if I have
a better answer than that.

196
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.385
Okay, [LAUGH] it's a good question.

197
00:11:39.385 --> 00:11:47.250
Anyone else?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

198
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.004
So a note about this course's website.

199
00:11:51.004 --> 00:11:54.670
If you see a code sample like this,
say it's on a yellow background.

200
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.090
That's probably hard to see, but

201
00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.310
I promise you that it is
the light yellow background there.

202
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.730
This code is not editable, but
if you see something like these.

203
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.471
This code is editable,
editable, that's hard to say.

204
00:12:09.471 --> 00:12:14.603
So if I put,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is super cool,

205
00:12:14.603 --> 00:12:19.340
you'll see it actually
being used down here.

206
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.581
So I really hope that

207
00:12:22.581 --> 00:12:27.473
as you're following along.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That you are messing

208
00:12:27.473 --> 00:12:31.767
with these, that you're breaking them,
that you're unbreaking them, and

209
00:12:31.767 --> 00:12:34.340
like discovering and like playing with it.

210
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.375
Cuz I think that's gonna
really help instruct you.

211
00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:43.998
And help you understand that if
I make this an H5 instead of H2,

212
00:12:43.998 --> 00:12:47.122
H1, it makes look different, and

213
00:12:47.122 --> 00:12:50.932
things like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

214
00:12:50.932 --> 00:12:55.756
I spent a bunch of time making this work,
so you better use it [LAUGH].

215
00:12:55.756 --> 00:13:03.196
That's the song of my story.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The one

216
00:13:03.196 --> 00:13:08.420
thing that I will say, is that if you
break, if you write something that breaks

217
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.590
in here, and it breaks really badly,
you might actually crash the webpage.

218
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.010
So just refresh the page.

219
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.050
So that is something that you can do.

220
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.130
And if you do refresh the page,

221
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.970
it's going to reset everything
back to the way it was.

222
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.390
So if you find some code that you're
really happy with and you wanna keep,

223
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.260
you should just copy and paste it into
a separate file that you're keeping.

224
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:34.624
So, that would be a good idea, as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any

225
00:13:34.624 --> 00:13:42.610
questions about that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

226
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So earlier when you said

227
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:50.420
the lighter color, we cannot edit it,
is that because of the value of the color?

228
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.750
Or is that the background that make it,
you couldn't edit it?

229
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.349
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's a good question.

230
00:13:56.349 --> 00:14:01.015
I made it look different, so
that you can tell that you can't edit it.

231
00:14:01.015 --> 00:14:05.045
And I did it on purpose, because some
of these things, if you edit them,

232
00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.639
you will definitely crash
the webpage [LAUGH].

233
00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:10.161
So it's to protect you from yourself, or

234
00:14:10.161 --> 00:14:14.029
protect you from me,
I think is probably more accurate [LAUGH].

235
00:14:14.029 --> 00:14:16.180
So there's no necessarily
technical reason.

236
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.840
It was a reason that I chose
to make it not editable.

237
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.686
Does that answer your question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

238
00:14:22.686 --> 00:14:23.767
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

239
00:14:23.767 --> 00:14:29.081
anyone else?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Someone

240
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:35.340
was asking inside that what is that
code that you're just editing.

241
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're about to find out.

242
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.910
Good question, what is that?

243
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.648
I will tell you, very soon.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

244
00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:46.190
like I'm being cheeky by
saying it that way but,

245
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.170
there's a very deliberate order that
these things kind of build together.

246
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.140
And so, if we go into many diatraps
too early, wouldn't get off track and

247
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.420
there is a lot of content.

248
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.544
Just so you know, it's insane to try and
learn web development in two days.

249
00:15:00.544 --> 00:15:03.113
it is just a ton of content, right?

250
00:15:03.113 --> 00:15:08.812
So you're gonna kinda have
the fire hose pointed at you and,

251
00:15:08.812 --> 00:15:13.182
sorry not sorry,
a little bit, right [LAUGH].

252
00:15:13.182 --> 00:15:15.332
Allows us to expose these things to you,
so

253
00:15:15.332 --> 00:15:19.190
you kind of like understand
the things that you don't understand.

254
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.560
And this is kind of a theory
that I have a little bit.

255
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.168
You have what you don't know, that you
don't know, and you can't Google or

256
00:15:28.168 --> 00:15:31.365
you can't talk about things that you don't
know that you don't know about, right?

257
00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:34.266
But as soon as things enter
into this realm, like,

258
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.091
I know that these things exist.

259
00:15:36.091 --> 00:15:38.238
And so when I go to try and
use that was like,

260
00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:41.810
I don't know how to use it right now but,
I know how to Google it [LAUGH].

261
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.880
And I think that's really important.

262
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.330
So that's kind of like a big point of this
just to introduce you to these things.

263
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.600
I don't expect you to walk away,
understanding all these things are 100%.

264
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.590
What I expect you to be able to
do is that you would be able to,

265
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.610
if you needed to do that, right?

266
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.440
So I'm exposing you to these concepts, so

267
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.240
that you can learn them more deeply,
as necessary.

268
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.520
And hopefully, that makes some sense.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I kind of like say,

269
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.270
I'm not gonna answer that right now,
that's the reason why I'm doing it.

270
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.627
It's so that I can come back
later in the course, and

271
00:16:14.627 --> 00:16:16.083
teach you some of these things.

272
00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:21.870
The other thing is that a lot of these,
I'm covering this broad range of topics.

273
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.400
And what's nice about frontend masters is
they have a lot of like depth into each

274
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.350
one of these.

275
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.520
So for example, we're gonna just
like scratch the surface of Git, but

276
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.770
if you wanna like deep dive into
Git there is an advance Git course

277
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.370
on here by Nina Zakharenko,
that is really good.

278
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.650
So you can check that out later.
