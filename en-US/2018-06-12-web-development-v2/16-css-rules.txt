[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: So if I have an h1 right here, so then I wanted to make this h1 red, something like this. So how would I do that? You can't do that with just html. You need something else to come in and affect that. So we're gonna write CSS rule to make that the case.

[00:00:20]
So that is going to look like this. This is what CSS looks like.
>> Brian Holt: So let's break down all of the pieces here.
>> Brian Holt: I have an h1 right here, right? This is called the selector. The selector selects. I think that follows, right? So in this case, it's gonna say, every h1 on the page, if it is an h1, then apply everything between the curly braces, okay?

[00:00:49]
So,these are called curly braces, in case you didn't know.
>> Brian Holt: [COUGH] So it's apply everything between the curly braces. Now we only have one. Thing to apply between the curly braces. We say the color red. Color is called a property. So there's how many properties. I said it right there.

[00:01:15]
There are about 350 properties. This is a lot like HTML that you really are only gonna use, again, maybe 50 to 100 of them. There's a lot, and there are people that are better at this than I am, that will probably use more things. But for the most part, there's gonna be about 50 of them that you're gonna use a lot, and then the rest you're rarely, if ever, going to use.

[00:01:40]
So color, as you may imagine, is quite useful. We use it quite a bit. So color is going to change the font color. That's just what it does. It's one of those things where you just have to know what these things do. And you can always Google it.

[00:01:55]
You could just Google how do I change font color, and I guarantee you it would be one of the first things on there. So,
>> Brian Holt: Then I'd put red here. This is called the value, and red happens to be a value that CSS understands. It understands what red means.

[00:02:16]
So that's why this works. It turns the color red.
>> Brian Holt: We saw hex before. You can also put hex here. The fact that I put right here, all the ones that CSS understands. It understands a bunch of different ways of doing color. It understands hexadecimal. It understands RGB.

[00:02:37]
This is how you would do RGB, right here. And it also understands HSL. Which I do not know nearly enough about HSL, it stands for hue, saturation, and lightness, I think.
>> Speaker 2: Luminosity [INAUDIBLE]
>> Brian Holt: Luminosity, it's a mystery, I'm just kidding. I don't know, I never use it, I'll put it that way.

[00:02:59]
[LAUGH] And then it understands a hundred and fifty what are called named colors. And there's some really weird named colors.
>> Brian Holt: But if you wanna understand more about like how CSS can do colors, I put in a link to an article there in CSS tricks, really explains everything really well.

[00:03:20]

>> Brian Holt: And I'm not going to explain it to you any more than that. But,
>> Brian Holt: And then you see here, there is a semicolon. That's just punctuation in CSS, it's saying I am done with this sentence. This really is like a period or a full stop for CSS.

[00:03:37]
At the end of every line, you just put a semicolon to say I'm done and I'm gonna go on to the next thing. It does have to be there.
>> Brian Holt: So I can put a lot of things inside these rules, it doesn't just have to be one thing.

[00:03:55]
You can see here I do a lot more. So I can do another color, lime green is the color. Font size, 60 pixels, that's what the px stands for. There are lots of ways of doing measurments in CSS. So just like I can say that I'm this person's five foot tall or so many centimeters tall or so They're like point zero zero zero one miles tall, right?

[00:04:22]
There's like many different measurements for doing height just like there is for CSS. You can do it in pixels, you can do it in EMs, you can do it in X, you can do it in centimeters, you can do it in inches. There's a lot of ways to do that.

[00:04:39]
I will say that mostly, you really only use pixels and EMs.
>> Brian Holt: That's maybe about it, yeah.
>> Speaker 3: So why are you defining the font size if you're already doing h1? That determines how big it is.
>> Brian Holt: That's a good question. So why are we telling it a different font size?

[00:05:05]
Our designs dictated that we wanted it to be bigger or smaller or something like that. I think the default font size for H1 is 36 if I'm not mistaken, 36 pixels, so you can see here that this is quite large. So the reason why we would do that is because we wanted it to be larger.

[00:05:25]

>> Brian Holt: We designed it for some reason to be larger than that. Because we wanted to. [LAUGH] I don't have a better explantion than that. Does that answer your question, or not answer your question? [LAUGH] It is a good question, though. Or for example, what if we want it to not be bold, right?

[00:05:47]
Cuz by default, yeah.
>> Speaker 4: I was just wondering if you could explain EMs?
>> Brian Holt: Sure, I think I have on here as well, another CSS tricks article about measurements. So I will explain EMs because they are useful. A lot of times we're doing relative sizes. We want things to be relatively sized rather than being absolutely sized.

[00:06:14]
So pixels is an absolute sizing. It's actually not literally pixels, just so you know. But we call them that. EMs is measured in relation to what your font choice is, right? So if I change fonts then I want the sizing to be relative to the font. So what it actually does is measure the width of a lower case m, something like that, and that's what m's is.

[00:06:40]
It's literally EMs long, weird, right? [LAUGH] But it ends up being really useful because that means even if you change fonts, all of your measurement will change in relation to your font.
>> Brian Holt: It's a little confusing, but it actually ends up being quite nice. There's also x ex, and that's the height of a lower case x.

[00:07:06]
I never use that one. [LAUGH] But you can see the CSS tricks here article to see all the rest of them. And that's how you write EMs right there, it's Cool. Any questions about measurements furthermore? I measure almost everything in pixels, probably more things than I should. It's just something that I've done for so long that you just kind of get used to doing it that way.

[00:07:42]

>> Brian Holt: You will see things occasionally in REMs. There's some weird behaviors if you have resized EMs. I don't really wanna get too deep into that rabbit hole, it's a deep rabbit hole. So you can have rems, which are root EMs. Which are, Is measured at the root level, which is the top level of the page, or based on the bodies, Width.

[00:08:11]

>> Brian Holt: We're gonna leave it at that. Basically, EMs are not affected by the command configuration, or pinch to zoom and things like that.
>> Brian Holt: Yep, so next thing I wanna talk about is font weight. So you can make things bold or not bold. And that's how you do that with font weight.

[00:08:40]

>> Brian Holt: So h1's are bold by default if you wanna make them not bold you have to say font-weight: normal. And you can also do light as well so if you want it to be extra thin. Text decoration, you'll notice that this is underlined, right? You can see the green underlining right there.

[00:08:59]
That's how you do that. You can also do overline. Which, I don't know why you'd ever want to do that, but you can. It's a thing. And there's also line through if you want to do strike through, text transform. So you'll notice here, that this is all in upper case despite the fact that this says, this is an h1 with normal casing.

[00:09:21]
That's something you can do with CSS and say, make this all upper case, which is kind of interesting, word of caution. I used to do localization for Netflix which is like translating from language to language, and I did all the coding for that. And if you do text transform uppercase it changes the meanings in different languages.

[00:09:42]
For example I know with Turkish it kind of messes with the meaning depending if it's uppercase or lowercase. So be careful if you're developing for different languages that you don't do text transform uppercase. We had to remove that a lot through the Netflix code base. You can also do lowercase or capitalize, which will capitlize the beginning of every word.

[00:10:03]
That works, too.
>> Brian Holt: Border 3 pixels, solid pink, so it's kind of hard to see there, but there is a pink border there, I promise. That is 3 pixels wide and it's solid. So this is called a combined CSS property cuz you can see there we have three different values for one property, right?

[00:10:28]
It's solid, it's pink and it's 3 pixels wide. This is actually the combination of border style solid, border color pink and border with three pixels. This is called like a short hand CSS property that you can kinda shuffle them all together. You'll see that a lot. That's why I wanted to show you that kind of up front.

[00:10:48]
But you can totally just use five pixels wide. You can change this to be double border or dashed or dotted borders, and obviously this can be any number of colors. So you'll see that a lot so just kind of get used to it. Parents and children, does anyone have any questions about.

[00:11:12]
What's going on here?
>> Brian Holt: Please.
>> Speaker 3: So in my browser, both my Mozilla and the Chrome, it's actually making the pink box. Is that what your talking about, around the actual letters?
>> Brian Holt: Yeah.
>> Speaker 3: You just can't see it.
>> Brian Holt: You just can't see it, so.
>> Speaker 3: Just want to make sure nothing's-

[00:11:33]

>> Brian Holt: Let's just make this black so you can see it. I chose a bad color for this projector. We'll talk a lot more about the selector. There's actually a whole section on it because it's a complicated beast [LAUGH]. Yeah, cool.
