[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: So, if I have an h1 right here and I wanted to make this h1 red, something like this. So how would I do that? You can't do that with just HTML. You need something else to come in and affect that. So we're gonna write CSS rule to make that the case.

[00:00:20]
So that is going to look like this. This is what CSS looks like. So let's breakdown all of the pieces here. I have an h1 right here, right? This is called the selector. The selector selects, I think that follows, right? So in this case it's gonna say, every h1 on the page, if it is a h1, then apply everything between the curly braces.

[00:00:48]
Okay? So, these are called curly braces, in case you didn't know. So it's apply everything between the curly braces. Now we only have one thing to apply between the curly braces. We say color, colon, red. Color is called a property. So there's how many properties? I said it right there.

[00:01:15]
There are about 350 properties. This is a lot like HTML, that you really are only gonna use again, maybe 50 to 100 of them. There's a lot and there are people that are more better at this than I am that will probably use more things but for the most part, there's gonna be about 50 of them that you're gonna use a lot.

[00:01:36]
And then the rest you're rarely if ever going to use. So color, as you may imagine, is quite useful. We use it quite a bit. So, color is going to change the font color. That's just what it does. It's one of those things that you kind of just have to know what these things do.

[00:01:54]
And you can always Google it. Like you could just Google how do I change font color and I guarantee it would be like one of the first things on there. So
>> Brian Holt: Then I put red here, this is called the value and red happens to be a value that CSS understands.

[00:02:14]
It understands what red means. So that's why this works. It turns color red. We saw hex before. You can also put hex here. In fact I'll put right here. All the ones that CSS understands. It understands a bunch of different ways of doing color. It understands hexadecimal. It understands RGB.

[00:02:36]
This is how you do RGB right here. And it also understands HSL. Which I do not know nearly enough about HSL. It stands for hue, saturation and lightness, I think.
>> Speaker 2: Luminosity.
>> Brian Holt: Luminosity.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah.
>> Brian Holt: It's mystery. I'm just kidding. I never use it, I'll put it that way.

[00:03:02]
[LAUGH] And then it understand 150 what are called named colors and there's some really named colors. But if you understand more about like how CSS can do colors, I put a link to an article there in CSS tricks, really explains everything really well. And I'm not going to explain it to you anymore than that but.

[00:03:26]

>> Brian Holt: And then you see here there is a ;. That's just punctuation in CSS. It's saying I am done with this sentence. It really is like a period or a full stop for CSS. At the end of every line, you just put a ; to say, I'm done and I'm gonna go onto the next thing.

[00:03:43]
It does have to be there
>> Brian Holt: So, I can put a lot of things inside this rules, it does just have to be one thing, you can see here, I do a lot more, so a new another color, lime green is the color. Font-size: 60 pixels, that's the px stands for.

[00:04:06]
There are lots of ways to, of doing measurements in CSS. So just like I can say that like I'm, this person's five foot tall or so many centimeters tall or somewhat like, they're like 0.0001 miles tall. Right? Like there's many different measurements for doing height. Just like there is for CSS, you can do it in pixels.

[00:04:30]
You can do it in EM's, you can do it in x. You can do it in the centimeters, you can do it in inches. There's a lot of ways to do that. I will say that mostly you really only use pixels and EM's. E-M. That's maybe about it.

[00:04:49]
Yeah.
>> Speaker 3: So why are you defining the font size if you're already doing h1, that determines how big it is?
>> Brian Holt: That's a good question. So why are we using, telling it a different font size?
>> Brian Holt: I guess, maybe that's what our designs dictated, that we wanted it to be bigger or smaller, something like that.

[00:05:11]
I think the default font size for h1 is like 36, if I'm not mistaken? 36 pixels, so you can see here, this is quite large. So the reason why we would do that is because we want it to be larger.
>> Brian Holt: We designed it for some reason to be larger than that.

[00:05:30]
Cuz we wanted to. [LAUGH] I don't know if I have a better explanation than that. Does that answer your question?
>> Speaker 3: Yes.
>> Brian Holt: Or not answer your question? [LAUGH] It is a good question though. Or for example, what if we wanted it to not be bold, right? Cuz by default, yeah?

[00:05:50]

>> Speaker 4: I was just wondering if you could explain EM's.
>> Brian Holt: Sure, I think I have on here as well, another CSS tricks article about measurements. So, I will explain EM's because they are useful. A lot of times, we're doing relative sizes. We want things to be like relatively sized, rather than just being like absolutely sized.

[00:06:15]
And so, pixels is an absolute sizing, it's actually not literally pixels, just so you know but we call them that. EMs is measured in relation to what your font choice is. Right? So if I change fonts, then I want the sizing to be relative to the font. So what it actually does is it measures the width of a lower case m.

[00:06:37]
That, something like that, right? And that's what Ems is, it's literally EMs long. Weird, right? [LAUGH] But it ends up being really useful because that means even if you changed fonts, all of your measurements will change in relation to your font. It's a little confusing but it actually ends up being quite nice.

[00:07:00]
There's also ex, ex and that's the height of a lower case x, I never used that one. [LAUGH] So, but you can see the CSS tricks here, article for to see all the rest of them. And that's how you write em's right there, it's. Cool. Any questions on measurements furthermore?

[00:07:31]
I measure almost everything in pixels, probably more things than I should. It's just something that I've done for so long that you just get used to doing it that way.
>> Brian Holt: You will see things occasionally in rem's, there is some weird behaviors if you have resized em's, I don't really wanna get too deep into that rabbit holes, it's a deep rabbit hole.

[00:07:56]
So you can have rems which are root em's. Which are ends measured at the root level which is like the top level of the page or like based on the bodies and width. We're gonna leave it at that. It's, basically, it's ends that do not, are not affected by the command configuration or like pinch to zoom or things like that.

[00:08:23]

>> Brian Holt: Yep.
>> Brian Holt: So, next thing I want to talk about is font weight, so you can make things bold or not bold and that's how you do that with the font weight. So h1's are bold by default, if you wanna make them not bold, you have to say, font-weight normal and you can also do light as well.

[00:08:49]
So if you want it to be like extra thin. Text-decoration, you'll notice that this is underline, right? You can see the green underling right there, that's how you do that. You can also do overline, which I dont know why you'd ever want to do that. But you can.

[00:09:06]
It's a thing. And there's also line through if you want to do strike-through. Text transform. So you'll notice here that this is all in upper case. Despite the fact that this is an h1 with normal casing, it's something you can do at CSS is say make this whole uppercase, just kind of interesting.

[00:09:26]
Word of caution, I used to do localization for Netflix which is like tanslating from language to language, right? And I did all the coding for that. And if you do text transform upper case, it changes the meanings in different languages. Like for example, I know with Turkish, it kind of messes with the meaning depending if it's upper case or lower case.

[00:09:48]
So be careful, if you're developing for different languages that you dont do text transform upper case. We had to remove that a lot throughout the Netflix code base. You can also do lowercase or capitalize, which will capitalize like the beginning of every word. That works too. A border of 3 pixels, solid pink.

[00:10:09]
So, it's kind of hard to see there but there is a pink border there, I promise. That is three pixels wide and it's solid. So this is called a combined CSS property. Cuz you can see there, we have three different values for one property, right? It's solid, it's pink and it's three pixels wide.

[00:10:32]
This is actual combination of border style solid, border color pink and border width 3 pixels. This is called like a short hand CSS properly that you can kinda shuff them all together, you'll see that lot that's why what I want to show you that kind of up front but you can totally changes this by 5 pixels wide.

[00:10:51]
You can change this to be like double border or dashed or dotted borders and obviously, this can be any number of colors. So you'll see that a lot, so just kinda get used to it. Parents and children, does anyone have any questions about what's going on here? Please?

[00:11:17]

>> Speaker 3: So in my browser both my Mozilla and the Chrome, it's actually making a pink box, is that what you're talking about?
>> Brian Holt: Yep.
>> Speaker 3: Or an actual letters.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah.
>> Speaker 3: I just can't see it.
>> Brian Holt: You just can't see it so.
>> Speaker 3: Make sure
>> Brian Holt: So, let's just, like make this like black.

[00:11:37]
So you can see it, yeah. It's just, I choose a bad colour for this projector. We will talk a lot more about the selector, there's actually a whole section on it because it's a complicated beast. [LAUGH] Yeah, cool.
