1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully,
the project was interesting.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.450
If you were looking, like as a side note,
for people looking at the website this

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.980
morning, it was broken and
not sure why it is unbroked, I think.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.900
If it is currently still broken for you,
make sure you do like a hard refresh.

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.280
So that's like Shift, Command R on Mac.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.830
And other buttons on other browsers.

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.060
Just yeah, Google it.

8
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.630
That's what I would say.

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.010
But if you're seeing images,
then it unbroke.

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.860
Okay, so, it sounds like most people were
able to do pretty well with the project.

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.673
If not, we're gonna work through it right
now and you can kinda see where you went.

12
00:00:41.673 --> 00:00:47.110
How you did in different things.

13
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.290
So if you click here,
this is kind of what we're looking at.

14
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.324
We'll do this title first then
we'll kind of move down the rows.

15
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.849
Does anyone have any questions
about it before we move forward?

16
00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:04.772
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you want to see this

17
00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:05.977
page, I made a little bitly link for it.

18
00:01:05.977 --> 00:01:15.099
It's bit.ly/news-project.

19
00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:20.690
Let me just make that a little bit bigger
on something, so that you can see it.

20
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.390
So, that this top link right here, this
is if you lost the link to the current

21
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.150
project website, intro-web-dev,
and this is news-project.

22
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.940
That's just gonna take you to this.

23
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.340
So just some easy, short links for you.

24
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.240
I'm gonna open my project
in Visual Studio code.

25
00:01:42.213 --> 00:01:43.173
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So to remind you,

26
00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:48.100
this is how you open something using
using your browser from your file system.

27
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.450
You hit File, Open File,
this should work on Windows,

28
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.600
this should work on
every operating system.

29
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.897
File open, well that's Command+O,
I also believe it's Ctrl+O for Windows.

30
00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:02.983
It'll open this dialog and then you
just gotta go find where you put it.

31
00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:04.760
For me it's on my desktop.

32
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.380
Desktop, right there.

33
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.320
FEM and find the index.html file.

34
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.230
And if you open that, you should see
whatever you have written so far which for

35
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.470
me it's thins profound statement
from the scholar Bryan.

36
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.220
So, let's just talk about like
how you kind of break this down

37
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.150
into a smaller problem that you can solve.

38
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.270
So, pretending that someone gave me this,
not the complete product.

39
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.590
We'll ignore that for now.

40
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.930
But, pretending more that someone
gave me like this image, right,

41
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.405
like this non-interactive image.

42
00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:47.215
Because like here,
I've made this in InDesign,

43
00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:50.946
I want you to turn this into HTML and
CSS, right?

44
00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:52.470
This is very common level.

45
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.530
This is how you'll interact
a lot of times with designers,

46
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.610
like here's my design,
now go make this a thing.

47
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.310
Go make it work.

48
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.710
So the first thing what I would do is
look at this as I kinda see three kind of

49
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.230
hard sections.

50
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.171
So I see the tile part,
like the news times at the top.

51
00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:08.638
I see this top row here and
then I see the bottom row, and so

52
00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:11.950
there's kind of three things that I'm
gonna break this problem down into.

53
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.645
So, the first thing I'm gonna start
with here is the news times part.

54
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.660
So, get rid of this.

55
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.000
And, I'm gonna make this something like,
you could make it a div,

56
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.120
you could make it a section.

57
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.950
We'll go with a section.

58
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.170
Like I said, there's no difference
between a div and a section.

59
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.340
But you're kinda just letting like,
here's a partition.

60
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.280
So some sort of partition on your web
site is a good place to use a section

61
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.840
instead of a div.

62
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.950
It has more meaning than a div.

63
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.440
So it doesn't actually matter.

64
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.910
It's not actually going
to change anything.

65
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.040
This is actually like documentation for
your future self.

66
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.640
That's how you choose which
kind of tag you're gonna use.

67
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.870
So we're gonna use a section.

68
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.330
It actually says right there.

69
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.300
A section element represents a generic
section of a document or an application.

70
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.651
Thanks, code.

71
00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:01.950
[LAUGH] So, that's pretty cool.

72
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.649
You can even just make
this an H1 all together.

73
00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We can do that.

74
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.480
Let's do that.

75
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.980
Each one.

76
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.150
Class, we're gonna call it like
the main title or main brand.

77
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.271
Let's go with main brand.

78
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.930
And you can call it whatever you want
to call your fictitious newspaper.

79
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.580
It doesn't have to be the News Times.

80
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.440
That was my,
I kinda based this on the New York Times.

81
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.335
That's why I came up with News Times.

82
00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:33.380
[LAUGH] But, up to you.

83
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.140
Okay, so I have the News Times.

84
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.100
I come over here, and
I have this now very,

85
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.270
very nice looking whatever right here.

86
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.162
The News Times,
this is exactly what I wanted to do.

87
00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:45.832
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

88
00:04:45.832 --> 00:04:50.735
I'm gonna come over here, and
I'm gonna go to my style.css.

89
00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:54.299
I'm gonna change this to main-brand, and

90
00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:58.670
I'm gonna make this much larger,
like font-size.

91
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.220
And when writing CSS,
it is a ton of guess and check, right?

92
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.510
So I'm just gonna say,
what happens if this is 50 pixels big?

93
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.570
Refresh the page, nah, maybe a bit bigger.

94
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.146
Let's do 60 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

95
00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:19.582
bless you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have that, and

96
00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:23.570
now I'm gonna come back over here.

97
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.645
It's like okay, I want this to be
centered, so I'm gonna say text-align

98
00:05:28.645 --> 00:05:33.660
Center and I wanna say font-weight
normal cuz I don't want it to be bold.

99
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.140
And then you're gonna do font-family and
cursive sounds nice.

100
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.240
So now if I come over here and refresh.

101
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.540
That's kind of a weird looking News Times
but sure, that's close enough.

102
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.202
What did I actually do?

103
00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:55.180
I actually used some
specific font on here,

104
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.280
if you wanna see what I actually used,
Snell Roundhand.

105
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.805
You should have guessed that,
I'm very disappointed in all of you.

106
00:06:03.805 --> 00:06:07.180
[LAUGH] Yep.

107
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.330
This is all of your faults.

108
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.380
Now there's a thing on Mac called font
book, that you can just kinda browse

109
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.910
through and see what's actually
stored on your computer.

110
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.240
So, here's like brush script MT.

111
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.020
That's what that looks like.

112
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.730
This is not typically what you do.

113
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.650
This is more for like fun stuff.

114
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.201
Because these are things that will be on
Macs and they won't be on other things,

115
00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:31.646
which is obviously an unacceptable
tradeoff if you were working on something

116
00:06:31.646 --> 00:06:32.602
like Netflix.com.

117
00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:38.140
But, nonetheless, or you can even do this.

118
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.680
Let's just, for fun,
there's a thing called Google fonts.

119
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.194
Click on this.

120
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:46.240
It's just a ton, a ton,
a ton, a ton of fonts, right?

121
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.670
I want something that's gonna be cursive.

122
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.610
Here you go.

123
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.313
We actually just want handwriting.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

124
00:06:56.313 --> 00:06:59.630
there's this.

125
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.710
This looks kind of nice, right?

126
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.540
The dancing script.

127
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.310
Or how about here, great vibes,
that looks perfect, right?

128
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.101
So we click on great vibes,
you can see what the font looks like,

129
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:14.876
then down here at the bottom somewhere,
where is it, I haven't used this a lot,

130
00:07:14.876 --> 00:07:18.853
select this font.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then you click on

131
00:07:18.853 --> 00:07:23.579
that and
then you get this link tag right here.

132
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.060
You just copy and paste this,
this little thing right here.

133
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.130
You come into your index.html and
you just paste it above your CSS.

134
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.721
So this is going to bring in
a CSS file from Google, and

135
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:42.320
it's going to bring this Great Vibes.

136
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.750
This is okay because now,

137
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.780
this is going to download that font onto
every person that visits your website.

138
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.150
Which is pretty cool, right?

139
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.349
So, I wanna then copy and
paste this font family, right here,

140
00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:55.410
down here at the bottom.

141
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.409
I'm gonna put that into my CSS,

142
00:07:57.409 --> 00:08:01.524
right where I wanna use it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

143
00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:05.681
instead of Cursive here I'm gonna have
font-family, Great Vibes, Cursive.

144
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:07.570
What does this mean?

145
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.680
It means that it's gonna try for
Great Vibes,

146
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.210
if it doesn't find that it's gonna say,
cool, just put on Cursive of some sort.

147
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.308
Which just means you're gonna get
this weird one that we have on there

148
00:08:17.308 --> 00:08:22.077
already.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

149
00:08:22.077 --> 00:08:25.570
it's gonna look like that but if now I
refresh the page, it's gonna wait for

150
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.000
a second and then, I need to save first.

151
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.071
Now, if I refresh the page,

152
00:08:29.071 --> 00:08:34.549
now I'm gonna get that instead.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's pretty cool,

153
00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.200
right, and
that'll work in every modern browser.

154
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.030
I wanna tell you why possibly
why you wouldn't wanna do this?

155
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.100
This adds a lot of page weight, right,
cuz you're gonna download an entire font,

156
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.380
that's a lot of stuff that, especially for
just the title of something.

157
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.780
You probably just wanna would
make that an image instead right.

158
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.970
So that's how you would put in another
font, but it's not something you always

159
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.590
wanna do if you're gonna bring in another
font, you probably wanna use it a lot.

160
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.870
Right, does that make sense?

161
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.360
The other thing is now Google has a little
bit of tracking on your website, right,

162
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.730
because now they're, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was gonna

163
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.830
ask is the browser smart enough to
only get the font once or does it

164
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.960
follow every page and reload every time?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, it caches it, pretty

165
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.630
smartly, yeah, that's a good question,
is how often is it downloading it.

166
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:25.050
It should cache it and keep it for,
let's look, you can actually see.

167
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.640
So I'm going to come in here cuz in my
dev tools there's a thing called network

168
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.490
monitor over here.

169
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.882
So if I refresh this again,
you can see this font family thing and

170
00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:39.415
you can see how long the cache control,
it says never get rid of this.

171
00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:43.933
So it's always going to keep it until your
browser just decides to throw it away, so

172
00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:46.449
that's a long time [LAUGH]
cuz your browser will

173
00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:50.211
keep quite a bit.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

174
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:53.104
that's a good question, but
what I was going to say before is

175
00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:56.480
now Google does have a little bit
of tracking on your webpage, right.

176
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.160
Every time that someone
comes to your website,

177
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.210
they're going to download the font and
Google keeps track of that.

178
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.162
So it depends on,

179
00:10:02.162 --> 00:10:07.124
like, it's all trade offs
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, but

180
00:10:07.124 --> 00:10:12.168
it's worth it, it is cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Things

181
00:10:12.168 --> 00:10:16.657
to think about.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now we have this

182
00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:20.345
News Times thing, I want it to be a little
bit more spacious, right, cuz if we're

183
00:10:20.345 --> 00:10:23.570
looking at this, there's a decent
amount of space up there at the top.

184
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.463
So what am I gonna do?

185
00:10:24.463 --> 00:10:29.742
I'm gonna pull over the margin on top and
bottom, so I'm gonna say margin

186
00:10:29.742 --> 00:10:34.868
maybe 15 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's actually less I want

187
00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:40.223
it to be maybe 30 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 50 pixels and

188
00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:44.581
let's actually do, we'll say this
is margin-top and margin-bottom,

189
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:48.590
cuz we don't actually want it on
the sides we just want it on the top and

190
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:54.368
bottom.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, pretty good,

191
00:10:54.368 --> 00:11:00.109
maybe about 60.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go,

192
00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:01.250
now it's a little bit better.

193
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.580
Now, we were talking about,

194
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.368
yeah, go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Isn't it easier to use

195
00:11:07.368 --> 00:11:14.926
the flex stuff for this just to.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Particularly for text, text

196
00:11:14.926 --> 00:11:17.867
is quite easy to do just without flex.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

197
00:11:17.867 --> 00:11:19.599
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you could definitely do

198
00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:26.804
this with flex as well, that would work.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

199
00:11:26.804 --> 00:11:31.244
we were talking about using combined
things you remember we did border,

200
00:11:31.244 --> 00:11:34.768
3 pixels, solid pink,
margin has one of these as well.

201
00:11:34.768 --> 00:11:39.700
So notice that margin-top and
margin-bottom are the same,

202
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.680
I can actually do margin: 60px 0,
like that, and

203
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.080
get rid of these bottom two and what that

204
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.220
means is top and bottom 60,
left and right 0.

205
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.620
Now you ask me like how do I know that,

206
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.150
just done this enough times that I can
remember it off the top of my head.

207
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.750
There's also, if you wanted to do
different things for top, bottom, left,

208
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:12.238
right you can also do margin, 60px 0

209
00:12:12.238 --> 00:12:17.860
60px 0 and
this would be the same as this and this.

210
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.710
It's north, east, south, west, just like,

211
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.280
that's how I remember it anyway.

212
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.240
There's also one that you
can do it with three and

213
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.460
I can never remember what the order
of the three is that's fixed so

214
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.350
I never use it, of consequences
I never used the three versions.

215
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:42.022
So and then the other one if you just do
one margin 60px that would be 60 pixels

216
00:12:42.022 --> 00:12:44.672
on every side and
padding works the same way,

217
00:12:44.672 --> 00:12:49.153
just so you know.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

218
00:12:49.153 --> 00:12:53.122
I show you that because you will see
this a lot, so if you see just with two,

219
00:12:53.122 --> 00:12:56.605
it's north south is the first one,
east west is the second one.

220
00:12:58.185 --> 00:12:59.335
Cool, feel good about that?

221
00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:05.330
So we got that, something that
I will do just when I'm trying

222
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.030
to figure out where stuff is being
laid out, I'll inspect element and

223
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:14.260
I'll just throw a border on it so
I can tell where is this actually sitting.

224
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.510
Cuz right now you can't really
tell where it is, right, but

225
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:22.530
if I just throw in a quick border and
say border 1px solid black.

226
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.335
I can see that's actually
the space that it's taking up,

227
00:13:25.335 --> 00:13:29.281
it's just helpful.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now I'm gonna

228
00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:32.902
refresh the page it's gone because
every time you refresh the page,

229
00:13:32.902 --> 00:13:36.660
it drops all the stuff that you had
written to it, so cool, good stuff.

230
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:43.559
Coming back here, okay, so
we're gonna tackle this next piece first

231
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:50.190
I'm gonna have some sort of section that's
gonna have all this HTML CSS in it,

232
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.636
and I have kind of three
subsections in it.

233
00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:55.990
And I noticed that I can style the left
one and the right one the same and

234
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.430
it's just the middle one
that's gonna be any different.

235
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.914
So, come back here to index.html,
I'm gonna do a section,

236
00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:11.567
I'm gonna call it,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know,

237
00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:16.207
row maybe
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, we talked a little bit

238
00:14:16.207 --> 00:14:20.820
about emit yesterday, I'm so used to
doing this that I just always do it.

239
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:27.750
So, I could do section, class equals row.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whatever and

240
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.651
write it up by hand, but
if you're using VS code or

241
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:37.803
if you're EMMET,
which you can find at EMMET.io.

242
00:14:37.803 --> 00:14:41.146
This will show you how to install it and
everything else if you're using Sublime or

243
00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:45.767
something like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But if I do section.row,

244
00:14:45.767 --> 00:14:49.433
like I actually put the real
CSS selector right there and

245
00:14:49.433 --> 00:14:52.714
I just hit tab it just
autocompletes it out for me.

246
00:14:52.714 --> 00:14:55.428
So it makes it really fast to write,

247
00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:59.825
make sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You could do the same thing

248
00:14:59.825 --> 00:15:04.498
if I did pound row, as you might imagine,
that's the CSS selector for having an id

249
00:15:04.498 --> 00:15:10.257
of row, so you can go really fast at this.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

250
00:15:10.257 --> 00:15:15.384
so now I have a row and I'm gonna have
kind of two different sections in it or

251
00:15:15.384 --> 00:15:17.810
three different rather.

252
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:18.667
I'm gonna have and

253
00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:22.430
I'm gonna call these articles because
these are kind of article looking, right.

254
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.561
So we're gonna go to article.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

255
00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:32.424
I could tells this as well article
dot we'll call this story,

256
00:15:32.424 --> 00:15:36.390
like a news story, something like that.

257
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.798
And these ones are gonna be
quarter stories right and

258
00:15:40.798 --> 00:15:44.483
this one's gonna be a half stories
cuz it takes up a quarter of the row,

259
00:15:44.483 --> 00:15:46.436
the middle one takes up half the row.

260
00:15:46.436 --> 00:15:52.375
So I'm gonna call this quarter as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay

261
00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:56.794
these ones have a title so I'm gonna put
this as you can put this as a h1 you can

262
00:15:56.794 --> 00:15:59.990
put it as a h2 you can make a case for
either one of them.

263
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.750
This is the h1 of the article
that's the h2 of the page

264
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.970
I would personally
probably call this an h1.

265
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.940
I tend to use a lot of h1s, but there
are people that would disagree with me.

266
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.220
So that is definitely your judgment call.

267
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.660
So I'm gonna call this story-title,
and what did I call it?

268
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.495
I don't know, we'll just say,
Student Learn CSS.

269
00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:26.732
Okay, then beneath it, it has what,

270
00:16:26.732 --> 00:16:31.152
like two paragraphs of text, so

271
00:16:31.152 --> 00:16:35.120
I'm gonna do story-text.

272
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.210
Now inside of them,
I wanna put this Lorem Ipsum text, right?

273
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.606
Code will actually generate Lorem Ipsum
text for you, which is quite nice.

274
00:16:44.606 --> 00:16:48.860
So I wanna say I put that angle bracket
to say, put this inside of there.

275
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.370
That's what the angle bracket means.

276
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.937
And I'm gonna say lorem maybe 40 words,
so lorem40 and

277
00:16:54.937 --> 00:16:59.501
if I hit Tab, then I get this
paragraph of Lorem Ipsum text,

278
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:04.102
which is pretty nice.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then,

279
00:17:04.102 --> 00:17:05.600
I actually need two of them.

280
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.893
So I can actually come in here and say,
hey, I actually need two of these,

281
00:17:09.893 --> 00:17:13.040
times two.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

282
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.350
Then you can actually
see the preview here.

283
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.860
It show us what you're actually getting
auto complete out, if you're curious.

284
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.569
So now if I Tab here, I get two of those.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And,

285
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:32.717
I come back over here, this one.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

286
00:17:32.717 --> 00:17:37.511
looks pretty good.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Question so

287
00:17:37.511 --> 00:17:42.308
far?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now if I look like I'm

288
00:17:42.308 --> 00:17:45.955
going really fast and
it's kind of hard to keep up with this,

289
00:17:45.955 --> 00:17:49.130
I've been doing this a really long time,
right?

290
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.470
This has literally been my day job for
a decade.

291
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:57.034
So you can feel okay if
you're not going quite this

292
00:17:57.034 --> 00:18:03.192
speed.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have done this so

293
00:18:03.192 --> 00:18:04.140
many times.

294
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.020
I used to work on a news website,
literally.

295
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:10.280
So [LAUGH] like this is stuff I've
all done before a bunch of times.

296
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.396
So please, don't feel bad if you're
going a little bit slower than I

297
00:18:14.396 --> 00:18:19.094
am.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so I'm actually

298
00:18:19.094 --> 00:18:23.760
gonna do the whole HTML for the row first,
and then I'm gonna do the CSS for it.

299
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.621
Cuz I think that would be the easiest way
to kinda get all the layouts correct.

300
00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:33.562
So the next article I'm gonna have here,

301
00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:39.560
it's gonna be another article.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's

302
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.160
gonna be another story.

303
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.930
And it's gonna be a half this time, right,
cuz it's gonna take up half the page.

304
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:51.282
Inside of that, I'm gonna have

305
00:18:51.282 --> 00:18:55.800
another h1 with story-title.

306
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.386
And this one's that dogs are adorable,

307
00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:05.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: are Adorable, okay?

308
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.840
This one has an image tag.

309
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.855
So the source was,
if you remember correctly,

310
00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:19.294
http://placecorgi.com.

311
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:26.764
Actually, I think this has to be s, https.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: / I think I

312
00:19:26.764 --> 00:19:32.173
did 500 clips, /500/300.

313
00:19:32.173 --> 00:19:34.930
This is gonna give me a 500
by 300 image of a Corgi,

314
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.270
which is everything that
I've always wanted.

315
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:43.339
And I'm gonna put here
a picture of adorable

316
00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:50.109
corgi dog.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's

317
00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:54.290
a big temptation inside of alt
text to say picture of, right?

318
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.840
But it's always a picture, right,
it's inside of an image tag,

319
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.450
the screen reader knows it's an image.

320
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.540
It's redundant to put
picture of something,

321
00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.080
just say what's actually in the picture,
just pro tip for you.

322
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.700
Okay, then underneath that,
it's gonna need one text paragraph.

323
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:18.220
So I'm gonna put story-text, and inside
of that lorem40, or something like that.

324
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.103
Okay, refresh here, and
looks like that link is not working.

325
00:20:25.103 --> 00:20:30.067
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why are you not

326
00:20:30.067 --> 00:20:36.010
working?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What did I do?

327
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:42.036
Let's look at here, inspect element.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope,

328
00:20:42.036 --> 00:20:43.410
you do have to do HTTP.

329
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:49.480
Okay, sorry.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go, okay.

330
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.630
So, this is not secure, http:.

331
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:58.960
I missed that up.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So make sure you get that.

332
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.976
We one more article, and
for the sake of time,

333
00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:03.920
we're just gonna say it's literally
the same as the first one.

334
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.560
So let's put that down here as well.

335
00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:14.216
And this will be Student Learns HTML.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

336
00:21:14.216 --> 00:21:19.146
coming back over here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We now

337
00:21:19.146 --> 00:21:21.440
have our kind of three stories for
the top, right?
