1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.822
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully,
the project was interesting.

2
00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:06.104
If you were looking like as a side note,

3
00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:10.055
if people were looking at the website
this morning, it was broken.

4
00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:13.860
I am not sure why it is unbroked, I think.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.215
If it is currently still broken for
you, make sure you do a hard refresh.

6
00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:22.673
That's shift-cmd-R on Mac and
other buttons on other browsers.

7
00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:25.708
Just yeah, Google it.

8
00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:26.265
That's what I would say.

9
00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:31.497
[LAUGH] But if you're seeing images,
then it unbroke.

10
00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:35.631
So it sounds like most people were able
to do pretty well with the project.

11
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:40.432
If not,
we're gonna work through it right now and

12
00:00:40.432 --> 00:00:46.964
you can kind of see where you went,
how you did on different things.

13
00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:52.097
So if you click here,
this is what we were looking at.

14
00:00:52.097 --> 00:00:55.578
We'll do this title first,
then we'll move down the rows.

15
00:00:55.578 --> 00:01:01.818
Does anyone have any questions
about it before we move forward?

16
00:01:04.477 --> 00:01:10.318
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you wanna see this page,
I made a little bitly link for

17
00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:13.814
it, bit.ly/news-project.

18
00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:17.481
Let me just make that a little bit bigger
on some things, so you can see it.

19
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.943
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that this top link right here.

20
00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:27.621
This is if you lost the link to
the current project website,

21
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:33.813
intro-web-dev and this is news project
that's just gonna take you to this.

22
00:01:33.813 --> 00:01:36.340
So just some easy short links for you.

23
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.407
I'm gonna open my project
in Digital Studio Code.

24
00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:47.371
So to remind you this is how you open
something using your browser from your

25
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:50.108
file system, you hit File &gt; Open File.

26
00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:51.517
This should work on Windows.

27
00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:53.872
This should work on
every operating system.

28
00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:54.851
File &gt; Open.

29
00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:56.602
Well, that's cmd+O.

30
00:01:56.602 --> 00:01:57.915
I also believe it's ctrl+O for Windows.

31
00:01:57.915 --> 00:02:02.720
You'll open this dialogue and then you
just gotta go find where you put it.

32
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.177
For me, it's on my desktop.

33
00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:11.805
Desktop right there, FAM and
to find the index.html file.

34
00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:17.554
And if you open that, you should
see whatever you have written so

35
00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:23.635
far which for me is this profound
statement from the scholar Bryan.

36
00:02:23.635 --> 00:02:26.434
[COUGH] So
let's just talk about how you kinda

37
00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:30.150
break this down into a smaller
problem that you can solve.

38
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.084
So pretending that someone gave me this,
not the complete product.

39
00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:41.044
We'll ignore that for now, but pretending
more than someone give me like this

40
00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:43.204
image like this non-interactive image.

41
00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:47.370
Like here, I've made this in design.

42
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.114
I want you turn this into HTML and CSS.

43
00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:52.470
This is very common.

44
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.748
This is how you'll interact a lot of times
with designers like here's my design.

45
00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:58.310
Now go make this a thing, go make it work.

46
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.287
So the first thing what I would do is
look at this is I kinda see three kind

47
00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:02.981
of hard sections.

48
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.961
I see the title part,
the News Times at the top.

49
00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:08.630
I see this top row here and
then I see the bottom row.

50
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.562
And so those are kinda like
three things that I'm gonna

51
00:03:10.562 --> 00:03:11.661
break this problem down into.

52
00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:16.787
So the first thing I'm gonna start
with here is the News Times part.

53
00:03:16.787 --> 00:03:21.688
So get rid of this and
I'm gonna make this something like you

54
00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:25.718
could make it a div,
you could make it a section.

55
00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:27.950
We'll go with a section.

56
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.251
Like I said, there's no difference
between a div and a section.

57
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:36.871
Here's a partition, some sort of
partition on your website is a good

58
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:39.509
place to use a section instead of a div.

59
00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:41.583
It has more meaning than a div.

60
00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:43.440
So it doesn't actually matter.

61
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.547
It's not actually going
to change anything.

62
00:03:44.547 --> 00:03:47.410
This is actually documentation for
your future self.

63
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.732
That's how you choose which
kind of tag you're gonna use.

64
00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:52.743
So we're gonna use a section.

65
00:03:52.743 --> 00:03:54.473
It actually says right there.

66
00:03:54.473 --> 00:03:59.511
A section element represents a generic
section of a document or an application.

67
00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:00.464
Thanks code.

68
00:04:00.464 --> 00:04:01.378
[LAUGH] So that's pretty cool.

69
00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:05.244
You could even just make
this an h1 altogether.

70
00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:09.299
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We can do that,
let's do that.

71
00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:16.815
H1 class, we're gonna call
it main-title or main-brand.

72
00:04:16.815 --> 00:04:18.774
Let's go with main-brand and

73
00:04:18.774 --> 00:04:22.930
you can call whatever you want to
cal your fictitious newspaper.

74
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.738
it doesn't have to be the News Times.

75
00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:28.440
I was kind of based this
on the New York Times.

76
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.561
That's why I came up with News Times,
[LAUGH] but up to you.

77
00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:35.140
So now, I have the News Times.

78
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.174
I come over here and I have this now very,
very nice looking wherever.

79
00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.730
Right here, the News Times.

80
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.707
This is exactly what I wanted to do.

81
00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:49.993
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna come over
here and I'm gonna go to my style.css.

82
00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:53.920
I'm gonna change this to main-brand and

83
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.530
I'm gonna make this much
larger like font size.

84
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.765
And when writing CSS,
it is a ton of guess and check.

85
00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:08.738
So I'm just gonna say,
what happens if this is 50 pixels big?

86
00:05:08.738 --> 00:05:11.570
Refresh the page, maybe a bit bigger.

87
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.664
Let's do 60 pixels.

88
00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:16.718
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, bless you.

89
00:05:16.718 --> 00:05:17.925
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

90
00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:22.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have that.

91
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.919
And now I'm gonna come back over here
as okay, I want this to be centered.

92
00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.441
So I'm gonna say, text align center.

93
00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:32.511
And I wanna say,
font weight normal, cuz I don't

94
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:38.318
want it to be bold and
then you do font family and cursive.

95
00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:40.593
Sounds nice.

96
00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:45.615
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now if I come over here and refresh,

97
00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:47.399
it's kind of a weird looking News Times.

98
00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:49.126
But Sure, it's close enough.

99
00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:52.850
[LAUGH] What did I actually do?

100
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.180
I actually used some
specific font on here.

101
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.891
If you wanna see what I actually used,
Snail Roundhand.

102
00:05:59.891 --> 00:06:03.535
You should have guessed that,
I'm very disappointed in all of you.

103
00:06:03.535 --> 00:06:06.210
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Really?

104
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, yeah,
this is all of your fault.

105
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.409
Now, there's a thing on Mac called
Font Book that you can just kinda browse

106
00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.666
through and see what's actually
stored on your computer.

107
00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:18.606
So here's like Brush Script MT.

108
00:06:18.606 --> 00:06:21.090
That's what that looks like.

109
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.269
This is not typically what you do.

110
00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:25.736
This is more for like fun stuff, because
these are things that'll be on Macs and

111
00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:28.999
they won't be on other things which is
obviously unacceptable trade off if

112
00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:31.257
you were working on
something like Netflix.com.

113
00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.426
But nonetheless.

114
00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.761
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or
you keep doing this just for fun.

115
00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:40.680
There's a thing called Google Fonts.

116
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.170
Click on this.

117
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.240
It's just a ton, a ton, a ton of fonts.

118
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.568
I want something that's
going to be cursive.

119
00:06:50.568 --> 00:06:51.192
Here you go.

120
00:06:51.192 --> 00:06:53.250
We actually just want handwriting.

121
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.247
So there's this.

122
00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:00.710
This looks kinda nice.

123
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.858
The dancing script or
how about here, Great Vibes.

124
00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:06.284
That looks perfect.

125
00:07:06.284 --> 00:07:07.975
So we click on Great Vibes.

126
00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:14.110
You can see what the font looks like,
then down here at the bottom somewhere.

127
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.355
Where is it?
I haven't used this in a while.

128
00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:21.881
Select this font and
then you click on that, and

129
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:25.510
then you get this link tag right here.

130
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.570
You just copy and paste this.

131
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.918
This little thing right here.

132
00:07:29.918 --> 00:07:34.630
You come into your index.html and
you just paste it above your CSS.

133
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.777
So this is gonna bring in
a CSS file from Google and

134
00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:41.924
it's gonna bring this great vibes.

135
00:07:41.924 --> 00:07:46.514
This is okay, because now this is going to
download that font onto every person that

136
00:07:46.514 --> 00:07:48.890
visits your website which is pretty cool.

137
00:07:51.402 --> 00:07:54.915
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna then copy and
paste this font family right here,

138
00:07:54.915 --> 00:07:59.120
down here at the bottom and we'll put
that into my CSS where I wanna use it.

139
00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:05.058
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So instead of cursive
here I'm gonna font family great vibes,

140
00:08:05.058 --> 00:08:07.570
cursive, what does this mean?

141
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.350
It means that it's gonna try for
great vibes if it doesn't find that

142
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.210
it's gonna say cool just put
on cursive of some sort.

143
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.007
Which just means you're gonna get this
weird one that we have on there already.

144
00:08:22.077 --> 00:08:24.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's gonna look like
that but now if I refresh the page,

145
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.330
it's gonna wait for a second and
then, I need to save first.

146
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.642
Then after I refresh the page,
now I'm gonna get that instead.

147
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:34.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's pretty cool, right?

148
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.200
And that'll work in every modern browser.

149
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.030
I want to tell you why this is possibly
why you wouldn't want to do this.

150
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.100
This adds a lot of page weight, right, cuz
you're going to download an entire font.

151
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.380
That's a lot of stuff that,
especially for just a title of something,

152
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.780
you probably would just make
that an image instead, right?

153
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.040
So that's how you would
put in another font, but

154
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.360
it's not something you always want to do.

155
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.080
If you're going to bring in another font,
you probably want to use it a lot, right,

156
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.870
does that make sense?

157
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.840
The other thing is like,

158
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.320
now Google has a little bit of
tracking on your website, right?

159
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.990
Cuz now they're, yeah.

160
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was gonna ask, is the
browser smart enough to only get the font

161
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.690
once, or does it follow every page and
reload every time?

162
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, it caches it,
pretty smartly, yeah.

163
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.630
That's a good question,
is how often is it downloading it?

164
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.950
It should cache it.

165
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:25.050
And keep it for, let's look,
you can actually see.

166
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.690
So I'm gonna come in here,

167
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.490
in my Dev Tools there's a thing
called Network Monitor over here.

168
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.800
So if I refresh this again,
you can see this font-family thing, and

169
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.630
you can see how long the cache control,
it says never get rid of this.

170
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.540
So it's always going to keep it until your
browser just decides to throw it away.

171
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.786
So that's a long time [LAUGH] cuz
your browser will keep quite a bit.

172
00:09:50.203 --> 00:09:51.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's a good question.

173
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.550
But what I was gonna say before is now
Google does have a little bit of tracking

174
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.480
on your webpage, right?

175
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.867
Every time that someone
comes to your website,

176
00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:02.157
they're gonna download the font and
Google keeps track of that.

177
00:10:02.157 --> 00:10:03.805
So it's all trade offs.

178
00:10:06.303 --> 00:10:07.847
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

179
00:10:07.847 --> 00:10:10.036
But it's worth it, I think it is cool.

180
00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.339
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Things to think about.

181
00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:18.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now we have this News Times thing.

182
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.620
I want it to be a little
bit more spacious,

183
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.580
because if we're looking at this,

184
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.280
there's a decent amount of space up there
at the top, so what am I going to do?

185
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.740
I'll put a little bit of margin on top and
bottom.

186
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:32.894
So I'm gonna say margin maybe 15 pixels.

187
00:10:32.894 --> 00:10:34.930
That's actually less.

188
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.112
I want it to be maybe 30 pixels.

189
00:10:39.302 --> 00:10:40.281
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 50 pixels?

190
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:44.867
Let's actually do, we'll say this is
margin top and margin bottom because we

191
00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:49.262
don't actually want it on the sides,
we just want it on the top and bottom.

192
00:10:52.302 --> 00:10:56.631
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
pretty good, maybe about 60.

193
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go,
that looks a little bit better.

194
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.810
Now, we were talking about,
yeah, go ahead.

195
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.811
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Isn't it easier to use
the flex stuff for this, just [INAUDIBLE],

196
00:11:10.811 --> 00:11:13.288
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [CROSSTALK]

197
00:11:13.288 --> 00:11:14.284
Particularly for

198
00:11:14.284 --> 00:11:17.078
text, text is quite easy
to do just without flex.

199
00:11:17.078 --> 00:11:17.997
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

200
00:11:17.997 --> 00:11:22.293
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you could definitely do
this with flex as well, that would work.

201
00:11:26.392 --> 00:11:29.316
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we were talking
about using combined things,

202
00:11:29.316 --> 00:11:32.970
remember we did like border,
three pixels, solid, pink.

203
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:38.855
Margin has one of these as well, so
I have noticed that margin top and

204
00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:44.328
margin bottom are the same,
I can actually do margin, colon,

205
00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:49.616
60 pixels, 0, like that and
get rid of these bottom too.

206
00:11:49.616 --> 00:11:55.220
And what that means is, top and
bottom 60, left and right zero.

207
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.620
Now you ask me, like how do I know that?

208
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.336
Just done this enough times that I can
remember it off the top of my head.

209
00:12:01.996 --> 00:12:04.868
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's also, if you wanted
to do different things for like top,

210
00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:05.960
bottom, left, right.

211
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:11.876
You can also do margin, 60 pixels, 0,

212
00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:17.860
60 pixels, 0 and
this would be the same as this and this.

213
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.778
It's north east south west.

214
00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:26.280
Just like a,
that's how I remember it anyway.

215
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.240
There's also one you can
do it with three and

216
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.540
I can never remember what order of
the three is, so I never use it.

217
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.231
Of consequences,
I've never used the three version.

218
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:40.325
And the other one,
if you just do one margin 60 pixels,

219
00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:42.530
that would be 60 pixels on every side.

220
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.072
And Padding works the same way,
just so you know.

221
00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:51.405
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But I show you that
because you will see this a lot.

222
00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:55.635
So if you see just with two it's
north south is the first one,

223
00:12:55.635 --> 00:12:56.515
east west is the second.

224
00:12:58.185 --> 00:12:59.931
Cool?
Feel good about that?

225
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.375
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we got that.

226
00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:08.111
Something that I will do just when I'm
trying to figure out where stuff is being

227
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:12.272
laid out, I'll inspect element and
I'll just throw a border on it so

228
00:13:12.272 --> 00:13:14.888
I can tell where is this actually sitting.

229
00:13:14.888 --> 00:13:17.341
Because right now you can't
really tell where it is, right?

230
00:13:17.341 --> 00:13:21.761
But if I just throw on a quick border and
say border, one pixel solid black I can

231
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:25.490
see that, that's actually
the space that's taking up.

232
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.928
It's just helpful.

233
00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:31.843
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now when I refresh the page
it's gone because whenever you refresh

234
00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:34.720
the page, it drops all the stuff
that you had written to it.

235
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.660
So, cool, good stuff.

236
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.830
Coming back here.

237
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.559
Okay, so we're going to
tackle this next piece first.

238
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.440
I'm gonna have some sort of section
that's gonna have all this HTML,

239
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.620
CSS in it and
I have kind of three sub sections in it.

240
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.900
And I notice that I can style the left
one and the right one the same and

241
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.430
it's just the middle and
that's gonna be any different.

242
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.249
So come back to your index.html.

243
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.565
I'm going to do a section.

244
00:14:05.565 --> 00:14:12.092
I'm going to call it,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know, row, maybe.

245
00:14:14.862 --> 00:14:18.234
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we talked a little
bit about Emmet yesterday, like I'm so

246
00:14:18.234 --> 00:14:20.900
used to doing this that I always do it.

247
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:26.989
So I could do section class equals row,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whatever,

248
00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:28.387
and write it out by hand.

249
00:14:28.387 --> 00:14:32.421
But if you're using VSCode or
if you're using Emmet,

250
00:14:32.421 --> 00:14:37.508
which you can find at emmet.io,
this will show you how to install and

251
00:14:37.508 --> 00:14:42.440
everything else if you're using Sublime or
something like that.

252
00:14:44.178 --> 00:14:48.322
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What if I do section.row,
like I actually put the real CSS selector

253
00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:52.940
right there, and I just hit Tab,
it just auto completes it out for me.

254
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.910
So it makes it really fast to write.

255
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.801
Makes sense?

256
00:14:58.463 --> 00:15:01.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can do the same
thing if I did pound.row.

257
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.830
As you might imagine, that's the CSS
selector for having an id of row.

258
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.388
So you can go really fast with this.

259
00:15:09.846 --> 00:15:12.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?
So now I have a row, and I'm gonna have

260
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:17.810
kind of two different sections in it,
or three different, rather.

261
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.660
And I'm gonna call these articles, because
these are kinda article looking, right?

262
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.317
So we're going to go with the article.

263
00:15:26.672 --> 00:15:28.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I could have just done that as well.

264
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.960
Article dot.

265
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:37.264
We'll call this like story like
a new story something like that and,

266
00:15:37.264 --> 00:15:41.342
these ones are going to be
quarter stories, right?

267
00:15:41.342 --> 00:15:45.199
And this one is going to be a half story
because it take up a quarter of the row,

268
00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:49.323
the middle one takes up half the row, so
I'm going to call this a quarter as well.

269
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:54.234
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
these ones have a title so

270
00:15:54.234 --> 00:15:58.564
you can put this as an h1, you can put
it as a h2, you can make a case for

271
00:15:58.564 --> 00:16:03.750
either one of them, this is the h1 of
the article but the h2 of the page.

272
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.650
I would personally,
probably call this an h1.

273
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:10.072
I tend to use a lot of h1s, but there
are people that would disagree with me, so

274
00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:13.220
that is definitely your judgement call.

275
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.356
So I 'm gonna call this story, title.

276
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.632
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And what did I call it?

277
00:16:18.632 --> 00:16:23.766
I don't know, we'll just say,
Student Learns CSS!

278
00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:24.980
Okay?

279
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:31.090
Then beneath it, it has what,
like two paragraphs of texts?

280
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.886
So I'm gonna do story-text.

281
00:16:34.886 --> 00:16:40.080
Now inside,
I wanna put this Lorem ipsum text, right?

282
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.496
Code will actually generate Lorem ipsum
text for you, which is quite nice.

283
00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:47.546
I put that angle bracket there to say,
put this inside of there,

284
00:16:47.546 --> 00:16:50.025
that's what the angle bracket means.

285
00:16:50.025 --> 00:16:55.517
And I'm gonna say lorem,
maybe 40 words, so lorem40.

286
00:16:55.517 --> 00:16:59.849
And if I hit Tab, then I just get
this paragraph of Lorem ipsum text,

287
00:16:59.849 --> 00:17:01.296
which is pretty nice.

288
00:17:03.443 --> 00:17:04.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then,
actually, I need two of them.

289
00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:08.714
So I can actually come in here and
say, hey,

290
00:17:08.714 --> 00:17:12.953
I actually need two of these,
times two, okay?

291
00:17:12.953 --> 00:17:15.011
Then you can actually
see the preview here,

292
00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:18.860
it shows you what you're actually gonna
autocomplete out, if you're curious.

293
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.420
So now if I hit Tab here,
I get two of those.

294
00:17:26.699 --> 00:17:29.551
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then I come back over here,

295
00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:34.279
nope, nope, this one,
yep, looks pretty good.

296
00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:37.497
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions, so far?

297
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.813
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now if I look
like I'm going really fast, and

298
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:48.854
it's kinda hard to keep up with this, I've
been doing this a really long time, right?

299
00:17:48.854 --> 00:17:52.997
This is literally been my day job for
a decade, so

300
00:17:52.997 --> 00:17:57.760
you can feel okay if you're
not going quite this speed.

301
00:17:59.834 --> 00:18:03.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have done this so
many times.

302
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.730
I used to work on a news website,
literally, [LAUGH] so

303
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.428
this is stuff I've all done
before a bunch of times.

304
00:18:11.428 --> 00:18:14.127
So please don't feel bad if you're
going a little bit slower than I am.

305
00:18:17.781 --> 00:18:22.732
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so I'm actually gonna
do the whole HTML for the row first,

306
00:18:22.732 --> 00:18:25.522
and then I'm gonna do the CSS for it,

307
00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:31.397
cuz I think that would be the easiest way
to kinda get all the layouts correct.

308
00:18:31.397 --> 00:18:36.914
So the next article I'm gonna have here,
it's gonna be another article.

309
00:18:38.904 --> 00:18:43.832
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna be another
story, and it's gonna be a half this time,

310
00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:44.450
right?

311
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.848
Cuz it's gonna take up half the page.

312
00:18:46.848 --> 00:18:53.775
Inside of that, I'm gonna have
another h1 with story-title.

313
00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:58.871
And this one's that Dogs are Adorable,

314
00:19:00.716 --> 00:19:03.957
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Are Adorable, okay.

315
00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:08.085
This one has an image tag.

316
00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:13.656
So the source was,
if you remember correctly,

317
00:19:13.656 --> 00:19:18.811
http://placecorgi.com, actually,

318
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:22.582
I think this has to be s, https.

319
00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:28.523
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Slash, I think I did 500,

320
00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:32.425
whoops, /500/300.

321
00:19:32.425 --> 00:19:35.419
This is gonna give me a 500
by 300 image of a corgi,

322
00:19:35.419 --> 00:19:37.985
which is everything that
I've always wanted.

323
00:19:37.985 --> 00:19:42.725
And I'm gonna put here a picture
of adorable corgi dog.

324
00:19:49.601 --> 00:19:53.628
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a big temptation
inside of all texts who say, picture of,

325
00:19:53.628 --> 00:19:54.131
right?

326
00:19:54.131 --> 00:19:56.277
But it's always a picture, right?

327
00:19:56.277 --> 00:20:00.410
It's inside of an image tag, the screen
reader knows it's an image, it's redundant

328
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.879
to put picture of something,
just say what's actually in the picture.

329
00:20:03.879 --> 00:20:05.078
Just pro tip for you.

330
00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:12.991
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then underneath that,
it's gonna need one text paragraph,

331
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:15.356
so I'm gonna put story-text.

332
00:20:15.356 --> 00:20:20.511
And inside of that, lorem40,
or something like that.

333
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:25.080
Okay, refresh here, and
it looks like that link is not working.

334
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.140
Why are you not

335
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.171
working?

336
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:36.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What did I do?

337
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:43.215
Let's look at here, Inspect Element,
nope, you do have to do http.

338
00:20:43.215 --> 00:20:49.280
Okay, sorry,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go, okay.

339
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.776
So this is not secure,
it's http:, I messed that up.

340
00:20:56.591 --> 00:20:58.802
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So make sure you get that.

341
00:20:58.802 --> 00:21:00.363
We need one more article.

342
00:21:00.363 --> 00:21:04.614
And for the sake of time, we're just gonna
say it's literally the same as the first

343
00:21:04.614 --> 00:21:07.056
one, so
we'll just put that down here as well.

344
00:21:07.056 --> 00:21:09.964
And this will be, Student Learns HTML.

345
00:21:14.068 --> 00:21:19.581
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So coming back over here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We now have our,

346
00:21:19.581 --> 00:21:21.440
kind of, three stories for the top, right?
