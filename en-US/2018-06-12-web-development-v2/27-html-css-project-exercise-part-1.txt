[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: This is actually gonna be pretty good, we're gonna have enough time for me to explain the project for you. And then we can break for the day and you all can come back and we can work out this project together. So this is actually gonna be you creating an index file with a separate CSS file.

[00:00:24]
And creating this kind of layout. This is gonna be an HTML in the CSS project. You should have an index.html file. I would suggest creating like its own folder. You can put it like in your desktop or something like that. And, inside of that folder having index.html, and have a style.css, it doesn't actually really matter what you call it as long as you're consistent.

[00:00:47]
And if you ever wanted to create this website. So this something that a designer would hand you this, hey I created this in Photoshop or In Design or Sketch, whatever the hipsters are using these days. Napkins, I'm not sure.
>> Brian Holt: And I want it to look like this, right?

[00:01:08]
And so you would go back and you would use HTML and CSS to recreate basically something of this nature.
>> Brian Holt: So you have all the tools. This is a far bigger project than I've given you before. But I also think it's useful for you to kind of try and struggle and Google and collaborate.

[00:01:31]
Feel free to talk to each other and all those all those sorts of things.
>> Brian Holt: And yeah, one thing I wanted to show you. So if I open my Visual Studio account here.
>> Brian Holt: I'm gonna create a new file.
>> Brian Holt: And let's just say this goes on Desktop.

[00:01:58]
I'm gonna call it FEM, for Frontend Masters. And, inside of here I'm gonna put index.html.
>> Brian Holt: Well, one thing I'll show you that's really useful specifically with code. If I put HTML:5 and just hit Tab. It generates all of that stuff for me. And I can't remember that off the top of my head.

[00:02:26]
You can leave the meta stuff as well. They're basically just saying like this is encoded in this particular way. This is how big I want the view port, so just, you can leave that. And I don't really actually know what this one does, I just leave it. [LAUGH] It's one of those things that I'm like, yeah, just leave it, it's fine.

[00:02:45]
We'll call this Frontend Masters.
>> Brian Holt: And we'll just put a h1 in here that says lol, okay? Okay, so now I have this HTML document. I wanna show you how to open it in your browser. So I have my browser open. This works with Chrome, or this works with basically any of them.

[00:03:07]
I'm gonna hit File>Open File, or Cmd+O, that's usually what I do. I'm going to find it which is on my desktop, I'm gonna go to fem, I'm gonna go to index.html and I'm gonna say Open. So you open it just like you would a Word document, but you do it with your browser.

[00:03:26]
It's gonna be on this, normally you go to http://, right? With this it's gonna be file:///, right? What's happening here is your computer is acting like a server.
>> Brian Holt: So your computer is acting like a server and serving itself. Your file system is basically a server. That's what's going on behind the server, literally your browser is making requests to your same computer.

[00:03:55]
That's how that works. So yeah, make sure you have this open and then if I come in here and change this to say omg, like that and I save it. Then I come over here, and if I hit cmd+R, it will refresh the page and I can see my changes.

[00:04:14]
So you can kinda do that rapid iteration. Same thing if you wanna create your index.css. I'm gonna come in here to this. I'm gonna create a new file by hitting Cmd+N. I'm gonna say styles.css. Again, there's no reason it has to be called that.
>> Brian Holt: I'm gonna put a new link tag in here.

[00:04:41]
So the nice thing, again, about code is that I don't have to remember everything. I can just type link and then if I hit tab, it just generates a link tag for me, which is really nice. This is called Emmet. This is available in Sublime and other things, E-M-M-E-T.

[00:04:57]
I'm not going to show you how to do it. In fact, there is a course on it from Mike North on Frontend Masters. I feel like I haven't plugged Frontend Masters enough today. So I'm gonna do it again, check that one out. Anyway, so I'm gonna say ./styles.css.

[00:05:12]
So I'm gonna save that and I'm gonna say h1s have color red. Come back over here, refresh, now it's red, okay? I wanted to to show you the cycle, cuz I don't want you be confused by setting these things up. I don't really care about that. I want you to you like learn the code.

[00:05:30]
You can figure all those stuff later. I would suggest taking this one road at a time. The first thing you should do, you should make like the title of the top which is the new times or whatever you wanna call it. The name of your fake news paper.

[00:05:46]
I want you to make a row of stores, the one in the left and the one in the right are gonna be 25% and the one in the middle is be 50%. There is gonna be an image here in the middle, and these are gonna be titles. And these are gonna be text right here.

[00:06:05]
So I'm gonna finish all of that first. So in order to get these to layout correctly, what does that look like to you? What are you gonna use that we talked about?
>> Speaker 2: Still flex.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, it's gonna be flex, good job. And they're the same height, so how are we gonna do that?

[00:06:26]

>> Brian Holt: Stretch, maybe. Yeah, what is it, align item stretch?
>> Brian Holt: So that's how you're gonna start with that.
>> Brian Holt: And let's see, and then I would finish this entire top row first, right? Before you even start on this one. Then on the second row, this is gonna be 25%.

[00:06:49]
This one's gonna be 75%. And I don't really care what the colors are, just make these different colors. But notice that they're equally spaced and they're in a column direction, right? So that was gonna be something more like flex column, right? Flex direction column.
>> Brian Holt: So other things, Google everything.

[00:07:13]
[LAUGH] When you forget it, Google it again. It's not cheating, it's literally what you're supposed to do. It's kind of the point, you are professional Googlers. So please, please, please Google everything. It's not cheating.
>> Speaker 3: Actually to that point, I saw a couple people on Windows having trouble how to figure out how to open up an HTML file in Chrome.

[00:07:37]
And I forgot even though I use Windows every day. So I Googled it, and it's Ctrl+O, it will let you get into your file explorer. That will then let you open your HTML file, so,
>> Brian Holt: Cool, perfect.
>> Brian Holt: The image, the one that's being displayed there is from a thing called placecorgi.

[00:07:57]
[LAUGH] which I just love this website. So they're just random images of Corgis. [LAUGH] It's fantastic, right? So what this is, remember we were talking about Lorem ipsum text? These are like place holder images. So instead of Lorem Ipsum, it's images. So with this, you can put a number.

[00:08:28]
So place corgi.com/500/300, it would be 500 width, 300 height. If you want it to be 600 then you do 600/300, right? So you just give it dimensions and it gives you back an image of a corgi in that dimension. So I wanted it to be more wide than it is tall, so I gave it 500/300.

[00:08:46]
That's just useful for laying out websites.
>> Brian Holt: So that's a good thing to know, yeah.
>> Brian Holt: The navigation box, which is this part down here, that's the hardest part. So this is actually, this uses display flex and then inside of it it uses display flex again, so you have nested display flexes.

[00:09:08]
That'll be useful to know.
>> Brian Holt: There's a lot of room to reuse classes on this. You could probably make all the titles one class, for example, right? So that's a good thing to keep in mind. Take it one step at a time, that's actually a big part of programming just in general.

[00:09:27]
When you are a programmer, they give you large problems and the the point is to take a very large problem that you don't know how to solve and just split it into two problems that are hopefully a little bit easier to solve. And then, break those into smaller problems and smaller problems, until eventually you'll write something that's like, I can do that, I know how to do that.

[00:09:42]
So break big problems into small problems.
>> Brian Holt: Let's see.
>> Brian Holt: So if you see here, I said, here's my complete version. If you click on it, that's an awesome picture. You can see how I did it here. I gave you the complete thing. You can open the Inspector and say, Inspect Element right here.

[00:10:08]

>> Brian Holt: The point here, this is not a test, right? I just want you to learn. So that's why it's there. It's all, you can see here, everything is all there. I would personally, for me, the way that I learned, I need to struggle, so I would not first do this.

[00:10:25]
But if you get stuck and you're just frustrated like about to throw your computer against the wall, don't. Maybe go out, don't do this right now, you should probably take an hour off and breathe a little bit. But after that, just take it easy, do what's best for you and your learning style.

[00:10:45]
That's what I wanna say.
>> Brian Holt: So you can cheat, that's fine, how I've solved it is not the correct answer, that's what I wanted to say. There are so many ways you could do this, you could totally do this using floats, and that's just fine, right? You could totally do this without using flex and flex-direction-column.

[00:11:06]
It's gonna be a million times easier if you do it that way, but totally up to you.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, saying there's a correct way is saying that there's a correct way to write a poem or a correct way to paint a portrait. There's artistry in here, as well.

[00:11:29]

>> Brian Holt: And yeah, good luck. Does anyone have any questions about the requirements or anything that we've talked about at all today? Please?
>> Speaker 2: You want us to have this done by tomorrow morning?
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, the first thing we'll do tomorrow morning is walk through, me writing it really quick.

[00:11:53]

>> Brian Holt: Okay, thank you for attending the first day. You survived, that's a big deal, you're 50% done. And you have learned two of the three languages. We are done with HTML and CSS. This is like your HTML and CSS capstone. So you learned two languages today, which is pretty damn cool.

[00:12:12]
And not easy, you can seriously feel pretty good about yourself. This is difficult stuff you have accomplished here. So one, I'm proud of you for sticking with it. [LAUGH] And two, you just have to learn one language tomorrow.
