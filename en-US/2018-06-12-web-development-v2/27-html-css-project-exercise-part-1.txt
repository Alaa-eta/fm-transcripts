[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: This is actually gonna be pretty good. We're gonna have enough time for me to explain the project for you and then we can break for the day, and you all can come back, and we can work out this project together. So this is actually gonna be you creating an index file with a separate CSS file and creating this kind of layout.

[00:00:27]
So this is gonna be in HTML in a CSS project. You should have an index dot HTML file. I would suggest creating its own folder. You can put it on your desktop or something like that and inside of that folder, have an index.html and have a styles.css. It doesn't actually really matter what you call it as long as you're consistent and then you're going to create this website.

[00:00:50]
So this is something like a designer would hand you this like hey, I created this in Photoshop or InDesign or Sketch. Whatever the hipsters are using these days, napkins, I'm not sure and I want it to look like this. And so you would go back and you would use HTML, and CSS to recreate basically something of this nature.

[00:01:18]

>> Brian Holt: So you have all the tools. This is a far bigger project than I've given you before, but I also think that it's useful for you to try and struggle and Google, collaborate. Feel free to talk to each other and all those sorts of things. And yeah, one thing I wanted to show you.

[00:01:42]
So if I open my Visual Studio Code here.
>> Brian Holt: I'm gonna create a new file and just say, this goes on Desktop. I'm gonna call it FEM for Frontend Master. And inside of here, I'm gonna put index.html. Well, one thing I'll show you that's really useful, specifically with code if I put HTML5 and just hit tab.

[00:02:20]
It generates all of that stuff for me and I don't have to, I can't remember that off the top of my head. You can leave the meta stuff, as well. They're basically just saying like this is encoded in this particular way. This is how big I want the view port, so you can leave that.

[00:02:37]
And I don't really actually know what this one does, I just leave it. [LAUGH] It's one of those things where like yeah, just leave it. It's fine. We'll call this Frontend Masters and we'll just put a h1 in here that says, lol. So now, I have this HTML document.

[00:02:58]
I wanna show you how to open it in your browser. So I have my browser open. This works with Chrome or this works with basically any of them. I'm gonna hit File > Open File or Cmd+O, that's usually what I do. I'm going to find it, which is on my desktop.

[00:03:16]
I'm gonna go to FEM. I'm gonna go index.html and I'm gonna say, open. So you open it just like you would a Word document, but you do it with your browser and it's going to be on this, normally you go to http://3 with this. It's going to be file:///.

[00:03:36]
What's happening here is your computer is acting like a server. So your computer's acting like a server and serving itself. Your file system is basically a server. That's what's going on behind like literally, your browser's making requests to your same computer. That's how that works. So yeah, make sure have this open.

[00:04:00]
And then if I come in here and change this to say, on g like that and I save it. And then I come over here if I hit Cmd+R, it'll refresh the page and I can see my changes. So you can kinda do that rapid iteration. Same thing, if you wanna create your index.css, I'm gonna come in here to this.

[00:04:24]
I'm gonna create a new file by hitting Cmd+N. I'm gonna say, styles.css. Again, there's no reason it has to be called that.
>> Brian Holt: I'm gonna put a new link tag in here. So the nice thing again about code is I don't have to remember everything. I can just type link.

[00:04:45]
And then if I hit tab, it just generates a link tag for me which is really nice. This is called Emmet. This is available in Sublime and other things. E-M-M-E-T. I'm not gonna show you how to do it. In fact, there's a course on it from Mike North on Frontend masters.

[00:05:02]
I feel like I haven't plugged Frontend Masters enough today, so I'm gonna do it again. Check that one out. Anyway, so I'm going to say ./styles.css. It's going to save that. And now, I'm going to say, h1s have color red. Come back over here, refresh. Now, it's red.

[00:05:23]
I wanted to show you that cycle, cuz I don't want you be confused about setting these things up. I don't really care about that. I want you to like learn to code. You can figure all those stuff later. I would suggest taking this like one row at a time like the first thing you should do is you should make like the title at the top, which is the New Times or whatever you wanna call the name of your fake newspaper.

[00:05:46]
I want you to make a row of stories. The one on the left and the one on the right are gonna be 25% and the one in the middle is gonna be 50%. There's gonna be an image here in the middle and these are gonna be titles, and these are gonna be texts right here.

[00:06:05]
So I would finish all of that first. So in order to get these to lay out correctly, what does that look like to you? What are you gonna use that we talked about?
>> Speaker 2: Is this the flex?
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, it's gonna be flex. Good job and they're the same height, so how are we gonna do that?

[00:06:25]

>> Brian Holt: Stretch maybe. Yeah, what is it? Align item stretch.
>> Brian Holt: So that's how you're gonna start with that. And we'll see, here's something and then I would finish this entire top row first before we even start on this one. Then on the second row, this is gonna be 25%.

[00:06:49]
This one's gonna be 75% and I don't really care what the colors are just make these different colors, but notice that they're equally spaced and they're in a column direction. So that was gonna be something more flex direction column.
>> Brian Holt: So other things, Google everything. [LAUGH] When you forget it, Google it again.

[00:07:17]
It's not cheating, it's literally what you're supposed to do. It's kind of the point, you are professional Googlers. So please, please, please Google everything. It's not cheating.
>> Speaker 3: Actually, to that point, I saw a couple people on Windows having trouble how to figure out how to open up an HTML file in Chrome.

[00:07:37]
And I forgot even though I use Windows every day, so I Googled it and it's Ctrl+O will let you get into your file explorer. That will then let you open your HTML file. So-
>> Brian Holt: Cool, perfect.
>> Brian Holt: The image, the one that's being displayed there is from a thing called Placecorgi.

[00:07:57]
[LAUGH] Which I just love this website. So they're just random images of corgis. [LAUGH] It's fantastic. So remember we were talking about Lorem Ipsum text? These are placeholder images. So instead of Lorem Ipsum, it's images. So with this, you can put a number. So placecorgi.com/500/300 would be 500 width, 300 height.

[00:08:34]
If you wanted it to be 600, then you'd do 600/300. So you just give it dimensions and it gives you back an image of a corgi in that dimension. So I wanted it to be more wide than it is tall. So I give it 500/300, that's just useful for laying out websites.

[00:08:53]

>> Brian Holt: So that's a good thing to know yet.
>> Brian Holt: The navigation box which is this part down here, that's the hardest part. So this uses display flex. And then inside of it, you use this display flex again, so you have nested display flexes. That'll be useful to know.

[00:09:11]
There's a lot of room to reuse classes on this. You could probably make all the titles one class, for example. So that's a good thing to keep in mind. Take it one step at a time. That's actually a big part of programming in just in general. When you're a programmer, they give you large problems and the point is to take a very large problem that you don't know how to solve and just split it into two problems that are hopefully a little bit easier to solve.

[00:09:36]
And then break those into smaller problems and smaller problems until eventually the writer is like I can do that. I know how to do that. So break big problems into smaller problems.
>> Brian Holt: Let's see. So if you see here, I said, here's my complete version. If you click on it, that's an awesome picture.

[00:10:00]
You can see how I did it here. I gave you the complete thing, you can open the inspector. And say, Inspect Element right here. The point here, this is not a test. I just want you to learn. So that's why it's there. You can see here everything, it's all there.

[00:10:19]
Personally, for me, the way that I learn, I need to struggle. So I would not first do this. But if you get stuck and you're just frustrated and about to throw your computer against the wall, don't. Maybe go out, don't do this right now. You should probably take like an hour off and breathe a little bit, but after that just like take it easy.

[00:10:42]
Do what's best for you and your learning style is what I wanna say. So you can cheat, that's fine. How I solved it is not the correct answer. That's what I wanted to say. There are so many ways you could do this. You could do this using floats and that's just fine.

[00:11:02]
You could totally do this without using flex and flex direction column. It's gonna be a million times easier if you do it that way, but totally up to you. Yeah, same as correct way to write a poem or a correct way to paint a portrait. There's artistry in here, as well.

[00:11:29]

>> Brian Holt: And yeah, good luck. Does anyone have any questions about the requirements or anything we've talked at all today? Please.
>> Speaker 2: So you wanna us to have this done by tomorrow morning?
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, the first thing we'll do tomorrow morning is walk through me writing it very quick.

[00:11:54]

>> Brian Holt: Thank you for attending the first day, you survived. That's a big deal, you're 50% done and you have learned two of the three languages. We are done with HTML and CSS. This is like your HTML and CSS capstone. So you learned two languages today, which is pretty damn cool and not easy.

[00:12:13]
You can seriously feel pretty good about yourself. This is difficult stuff that you have accomplished here. So one, I'm proud of you for sticking with it. [LAUGH] And two, you just have to learn one language tomorrow.
