00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:01.295
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about HTML so

2
00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:06.151
far?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you actually,

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.327
if you put that slash at the end of input,

4
00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:11.954
you have a space before it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

5
00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:15.006
I think that's just
a stylistic preference.

6
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.739
I think that's technically fine.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You don't need it.

7
00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.681
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't need it, yeah.

8
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.339
I always put it there.

9
00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.998
I don't know if I have a good reason.

10
00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:25.925
Habit, I suppose.

11
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:29.093
[LAUGH] It's a good question.

12
00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:31.419
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So for best practices,

13
00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.827
should you use the closing slash or
skip it or

14
00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:39.421
is that really just stylistic preferences?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think the answer to

15
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:41.582
the question is stylistic preference.

16
00:00:41.582 --> 00:00:45.673
I used to not ever put the slash, and
then I started writing React for you.

17
00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:51.453
With React specifically which
is not the same as writing HTML,

18
00:00:51.453 --> 00:00:53.644
but React requires it.

19
00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:58.228
So that's why I got you back in
the habit of putting it in again.

20
00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:01.192
So it's up to you, I think is the answer.

21
00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:05.532
Good question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyone else?

22
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.985
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: In your example where you

23
00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:13.064
have the word hi, you have the hi
on a separate line from h1 and

24
00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:15.417
the closing bracket on h1.

25
00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:19.859
Does it have to be on a separate line or
can they all be on one single line,

26
00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.999
all the h1, opening and closing?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I like that question.

27
00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.461
Thank you very much.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can

28
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:32.249
definitely do this, right?

29
00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:33.499
This is your question.

30
00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.362
This is totally valid HTML.

31
00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.276
This will go through a browser and
it will work perfectly.

32
00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:39.654
This is very hard to read.

33
00:01:39.654 --> 00:01:44.813
[LAUGH] So the white space is what's this

34
00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:49.855
is called.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

35
00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:51.771
if I go back to here like this.

36
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:55.541
This white space here, so all these
spaces and returns and things like that,

37
00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:56.594
it's meaningless.

38
00:01:56.594 --> 00:01:58.576
It doesn't actually do anything.

39
00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.419
It's purely for you as the programmer
to make it more readable for you.

40
00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:03.755
So this is far less dense.

41
00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:06.380
So it's easy for
my eye to like peruse very quickly,

42
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.477
which is ultimately what I'm going for.

43
00:02:08.477 --> 00:02:11.808
So even though like there's
a bunch of space here,

44
00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:15.222
you'll notice that there's
no space before this.

45
00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:19.777
HTML cuts off all of that space.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

46
00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:22.117
it's a good question,
does that answer your question?

47
00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:23.371
Cool.

48
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:28.031
So it's purely for you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other questions?

49
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:30.665
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have one more question.

50
00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:31.191
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

51
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:32.481
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So what is div, and

52
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:34.467
when do you use it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll get to it,

53
00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:35.596
just a second.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

54
00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:37.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.

55
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.715
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So

56
00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:43.398
when I do the first h1 and
I type in, say h5,

57
00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:48.207
it seems to and
input into the result the h5 and

58
00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:53.463
it does highlight the second h1 in red.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's like this?

59
00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:55.527
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: It let's me do that, yeah.

60
00:02:55.527 --> 00:02:57.699
Is that-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question,

61
00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.786
it's what's happening here?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

62
00:03:00.786 --> 00:03:01.311
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: HTML and

63
00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:05.292
browsers in particular are very
good at dealing with bad HTML.

64
00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:10.123
Because we have decades of bad programmers
behind us, and good programmers,

65
00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.815
but also bad programmers.

66
00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:16.679
This used to be quirks mode, anyone that
had to deal with quirks mode will probably

67
00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:21.590
get a little bit of PTSD right now.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But the short

68
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.659
answer to it is, I don't actually know
how it's going to handle this but

69
00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.325
the browser is very resilient and it will
try to recover from mistakes like that.

70
00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:36.918
So, this being red right here is just,
this has a syntax highlighter on it.

71
00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:39.522
That's why this is green and
this is black.

72
00:03:39.522 --> 00:03:41.524
Cuz that's the syntax
highlighter breaking,

73
00:03:41.524 --> 00:03:46.298
that's why it's red right there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

74
00:03:46.298 --> 00:03:49.748
looks like it's in each actually
being rendered as an h5.

75
00:03:49.748 --> 00:03:53.924
Yeah, so it looks like this is respecting
the h5, which means that Firefox in this

76
00:03:53.924 --> 00:04:00.799
particular case is respecting it as an h5.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good

77
00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.821
question though.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

78
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:10.499
I think the sum of the story is that
the browser will do it's best to recover.

79
00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:16.615
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And does a pretty

80
00:04:16.615 --> 00:04:20.321
good job.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any other

81
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:25.422
questions?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

82
00:04:28.138 --> 00:04:29.976
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there are,

83
00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:34.580
I looked it up, how many there are?

84
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.255
We're gonna go to some of the more
important ones right here but-

85
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:48.204
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's some 300 odd tags,

86
00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.655
I think there's 300, 350ish tags.

87
00:04:51.655 --> 00:04:54.942
But you definitely, definitely, definitely
do not need to know all of them.

88
00:04:54.942 --> 00:04:57.128
I don't know all of them,
I probably don't even know half.

89
00:04:57.128 --> 00:04:59.265
I guarantee you I don't
even know half of it.

90
00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:03.109
I'm gonna guess 50 at most.

91
00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:07.475
There's probably like 1
to 30 that you use a lot,

92
00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:13.641
30 to 50 of them that you use sometimes
and the rest that you use never.

93
00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:18.729
[LAUGH] And there's a certain amount of
them that are deprecated is the word that

94
00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.989
we would use for that, which is they used
to exist, and they are no longer in use.

95
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:28.114
And you are discouraged from using them,
so there's a bunch of those as well.

96
00:05:28.114 --> 00:05:31.148
I mean HTML is how old?

97
00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:32.285
Like 30 years old or

98
00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:36.721
something like that maybe longer.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

99
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:40.254
when they were designing how
to use HTML 30 years ago,

100
00:05:40.254 --> 00:05:44.476
they did not know how we were going
to be using and abusing it today.

101
00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:48.351
So they could never have predicted
things that are gonna be good ideas and

102
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:49.568
things are bad ideas.

103
00:05:49.568 --> 00:05:54.191
That's why we're on HTML 5.1 right now,
which is means from

104
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:59.169
fifth major event and 0.1 they
added a couple more things as well.

105
00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.195
So there's a bunch of stuff that
has changed over the years.

106
00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:04.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we'll get a bit more

107
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.518
into that later as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

108
00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:10.873
now we'll talk about divs
here in just a second but

109
00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:14.814
we're gonna explore a bunch of different
kinds of tags that you should know about.

110
00:06:14.814 --> 00:06:18.823
These are the, I would deem to
be some of the more useful ones.

111
00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:20.443
So we talked about h1 through h6,

112
00:06:20.443 --> 00:06:26.983
which are headings.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

113
00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:31.107
this, for example is an h1, or no,
this is an h2, I think, right here,

114
00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:36.195
this Types of Tags.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's gonna be some

115
00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:39.397
sort of heading on the page, something
that you would have at the top, right?

116
00:06:39.397 --> 00:06:43.928
That's gonna be some sort of title
some sort of important descriptive

117
00:06:43.928 --> 00:06:46.480
that you want that kind of to stand out.

118
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.601
That's why this one is bigger,
it's bolder, it's a heading, right?

119
00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:52.392
You're scrolling down, what are you
doing if you come to this page and

120
00:06:52.392 --> 00:06:55.421
you just peruse it really quick,
you're gonna scroll down really quick and

121
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:56.867
you just look at headings, right?

122
00:06:56.867 --> 00:07:01.725
That's kind of what they're for
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

123
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:03.352
that's why you have h1 through h6.

124
00:07:03.352 --> 00:07:06.340
On this particular page,
this basic HTML, that's the h1,

125
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.473
because that's the most important thing.

126
00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:13.117
This entire page is about basic HTML,
okay?

127
00:07:13.117 --> 00:07:20.089
And then everything underneath that, these
h2s are kinda subheadings in here, right?

128
00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:25.311
So you can scroll down and look at types
of tags and those sorts of things.

129
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:29.711
And then if this had headings underneath
it, then it would have an h3.

130
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:35.103
And so on and so forth.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

131
00:07:35.103 --> 00:07:38.827
just to kind of highlight,
a bunch of these are kind of they're

132
00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:43.697
pretty squishy subjects that there is not
necessarily like the right way to do it.

133
00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:47.467
I kinda likened it to formatting
in Microsoft Word document.

134
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.964
There's multiple ways to do this.

135
00:07:48.964 --> 00:07:52.973
It's as much artistic
license as it is engineering.

136
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:55.335
Which you're gonna find out
a lot throughout this course.

137
00:07:55.335 --> 00:07:59.506
It's like a lot of this is
just kind of doing your best.

138
00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:01.522
Taking the knowledge that you have and

139
00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:04.044
just applying it the best
way that you know how.

140
00:08:04.044 --> 00:08:05.900
Did it makes sense?

141
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.804
Any questions?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

142
00:08:14.887 --> 00:08:17.845
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: P tags.

143
00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:20.104
P stands for paragraph.

144
00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:25.012
And you'll put paragraphs of
text inside of the p tags.

145
00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:30.168
So up here, this right here,
that little bit, that is a p tag, right?

146
00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:32.833
It's a paragraph.

147
00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:36.199
And so if you have multiple
paragraphs next to each other, right?

148
00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:42.595
This is multiple p tags right here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's what it is,

149
00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:45.849
it's whatever you will put
inside of a paragraph.

150
00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:49.365
So you're gonna use p tags quite a bit.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

151
00:08:49.365 --> 00:08:52.727
only text goes inside of p tags.

152
00:08:52.727 --> 00:08:55.914
So for example you can have like
a div instead of a p tag or

153
00:08:55.914 --> 00:08:59.811
you can have a h1 inside a p tag,
only texts ends up going in there.

154
00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:04.692
And some sort of expands can go in there,
things that are describe text,

155
00:09:04.692 --> 00:09:07.504
which will get to expand in just a second.

156
00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:11.252
But there's a bunch of things
that cannot go inside of a p tag.

157
00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:14.886
And what the browser actually do if you do
try to put something inside there it will

158
00:09:14.886 --> 00:09:15.909
actually kick it out.

159
00:09:15.909 --> 00:09:17.293
So it looks really weird.

160
00:09:17.293 --> 00:09:20.405
So don't put weird things in there.

161
00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:25.554
[LAUGH] Anchor tags, that's an a,

162
00:09:25.554 --> 00:09:29.468
these are links, right?

163
00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:31.976
And it stands for Anchor.

164
00:09:31.976 --> 00:09:34.131
I can't remember why it stands for Anchor.

165
00:09:34.131 --> 00:09:37.899
I don't know why that's the appropriate
term for it, it's just what you call it.

166
00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:41.906
[LAUGH] So this right here,
this link right here,

167
00:09:41.906 --> 00:09:48.364
where you put your pointer over and it
turns to a cursor, so you can click on it.

168
00:09:48.364 --> 00:09:52.531
That is an Anchor tag, that is a link.

169
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:58.994
So if you look here, see the a
href=https://www.frontendmasters.com,

170
00:09:58.994 --> 00:09:59.663
right?

171
00:09:59.663 --> 00:10:04.770
So this href is where it
actually ends up going.

172
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.075
Here's another quotation mark right there,
whatever,

173
00:10:06.075 --> 00:10:10.093
that's fine.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then this is the text

174
00:10:10.093 --> 00:10:14.428
inside of it so you can see here, this
link actually doesn't go anywhere, but

175
00:10:14.428 --> 00:10:16.014
that's what it looks like.

176
00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:19.818
So you use a tags to create links, right?

177
00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:26.508
And you would link it to some other URL.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: URL stands for

178
00:10:26.508 --> 00:10:30.968
Uniform Resource Location, I think.

179
00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:34.712
It's like whatever like the address is,
the web address, so

180
00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:38.817
I can see up here, this is the web
address for this particular page.

181
00:10:38.817 --> 00:10:41.678
That's what would go inside
of here instead of the href,

182
00:10:41.678 --> 00:10:45.326
you would put it in there, and then
the link where take you to that place.

183
00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:48.985
Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

184
00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:50.737
I'm seeing mostly head nods, so

185
00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:56.648
I feel pretty good about that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That href,

186
00:10:56.648 --> 00:10:59.505
this part right here,
is called an attribute.

187
00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:01.003
And that is in the next lesson.

188
00:11:01.003 --> 00:11:02.826
We will talk a lot more about attributes.

189
00:11:02.826 --> 00:11:10.012
But basically, you can give additional
information to these tags via attributes.

190
00:11:10.012 --> 00:11:12.199
And again, we will go over that,
we actually have a whole section on it.

191
00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:14.322
So if that doesn't make sense right now,

192
00:11:14.322 --> 00:11:20.205
it's coming.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Div,

193
00:11:20.205 --> 00:11:23.409
okay, so this one we had a question about.

194
00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:25.794
It is short for division.

195
00:11:25.794 --> 00:11:29.273
And I like to think of
divs as cardboard boxes.

196
00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:33.286
That it's not actually, the cardboard
box is never the important part, right?

197
00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:35.030
It's actually what's inside
of the cardboard box.

198
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.014
So it's just like a,
it's a box that you stick stuff in,

199
00:11:39.014 --> 00:11:42.516
you stick other more
important things inside of.

200
00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:46.245
A div in and of itself has no what
we would call semantic meaning.

201
00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:49.615
It doesn't necessarily mean anything
because it's inside of a div.

202
00:11:49.615 --> 00:11:55.815
It's just kind of a no name
container that you put stuff into.

203
00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:58.321
Does that makes sense?

204
00:11:58.321 --> 00:12:02.399
You're gonna use divs everywhere, because
there's a lot of times that you can't

205
00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:09.538
really describe anything in particular.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't need a tag

206
00:12:09.538 --> 00:12:13.318
that has any sort of semantic meaning.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah,

207
00:12:13.318 --> 00:12:16.082
it's a generic tag for
grouping things together.

208
00:12:16.082 --> 00:12:19.368
Divs can be really useful with CSS.

209
00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:22.195
And that's in particular where
I'm gonna use them a bunch,

210
00:12:22.195 --> 00:12:24.534
cuz they're really useful for
styling with CSS.

211
00:12:24.534 --> 00:12:28.703
So that's why you'll see those a lot.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

212
00:12:28.703 --> 00:12:33.846
if you had a blog post kinda thing, you'll
kinda like group like the entire blog post

213
00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:40.827
container into like one div usually.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Spans.

214
00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:43.176
Spans are like sorta like divs, but

215
00:12:43.176 --> 00:12:47.105
they have no necessary semantic
meaning in of themselves.

216
00:12:47.105 --> 00:12:51.345
But-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right there,

217
00:12:51.345 --> 00:12:56.545
excuse me.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so yes, spans.

218
00:12:56.545 --> 00:13:01.526
If a div is a cardboard box,
a span is like a zip block bag.

219
00:13:01.526 --> 00:13:07.151
It's like a smaller div, and
you'll have spans inside of paragraphs.

220
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:09.628
So if I wanted to just highlight
this block of text right there,

221
00:13:09.628 --> 00:13:12.173
something like that,
I would put that inside of a span, right?

222
00:13:12.173 --> 00:13:16.101
So it actually looks like a small
snippet of whatever you're dealing with.

223
00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:17.718
You can have spans really
inside of anything.

224
00:13:17.718 --> 00:13:21.331
You can have them inside of h1s,
you can have them inside of paragraphs,

225
00:13:21.331 --> 00:13:23.503
inside of divs, they fit kind of anywhere.

226
00:13:23.503 --> 00:13:25.135
And it's just like, for

227
00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:29.343
this small block of something,
I'm gonna put a span around it.

228
00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:32.476
I don't actually end up
using them a terrible lot.

229
00:13:32.476 --> 00:13:34.669
It's not usually that I need
to do something like that.

230
00:13:34.669 --> 00:13:36.571
But if I needed to,
that's how I would do it.

231
00:13:39.807 --> 00:13:43.408
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so ols and uls.

232
00:13:43.408 --> 00:13:48.238
So ol stands for ordered list,
and ul stands for unordered list.

233
00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:53.406
So what you see here, where I had this
kinda list of tags that I'm talking about,

234
00:13:53.406 --> 00:13:55.162
this is an unordered list.

235
00:13:55.162 --> 00:13:57.575
So it's an unordered list
because I could swap a and p,

236
00:13:57.575 --> 00:13:59.569
and it doesn't really make any difference,

237
00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:02.682
it doesn't change the meaning of the list,
it's an unordered list.

238
00:14:02.682 --> 00:14:04.492
It's just a list of stuff, and

239
00:14:04.492 --> 00:14:07.914
it doesn't really matter what
order it comes in, right?

240
00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:10.699
So that's why this is an unordered list.

241
00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:13.837
If something was an ordered list,
if I changed the order of it,

242
00:14:13.837 --> 00:14:15.565
it would change the meaning of it.

243
00:14:15.565 --> 00:14:16.920
So for an example,

244
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.106
I have here the list of the ten most
populist cities in the world, right?

245
00:14:22.106 --> 00:14:26.344
I can't switch number one and number two
or else that list is now incorrect, right?

246
00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:29.712
So that's when you would use an ol,
an order list.

247
00:14:29.712 --> 00:14:34.009
And instead of here having bullets
you would have numbers, right?

248
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:36.683
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

249
00:14:36.683 --> 00:14:40.315
So ol is ordered list,
ul is unordered list and

250
00:14:40.315 --> 00:14:44.889
then all of the individual
elements inside of it, right?

251
00:14:44.889 --> 00:14:50.126
So the span one, the ol one,
the button one, right?

252
00:14:50.126 --> 00:14:53.403
These are lis,
they're list elements, right?

253
00:14:53.403 --> 00:14:58.234
So it's one individual entry inside
of the ol or inside of the ul.

254
00:14:58.234 --> 00:15:02.603
So you can see here I have
an example this is a ul so

255
00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:06.973
it'd be an unordered list,
the ul ends here and

256
00:15:06.973 --> 00:15:12.460
I have li here, another li here,
another li here, right?

257
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.315
So you'll have an opening ul or ol, and
then you'll have a bunch of lis in it,

258
00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:20.700
and then you'll close your ul or
ol, just like that.

259
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.608
Any questions about that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's useful for

260
00:15:25.608 --> 00:15:27.383
making lists of things.

261
00:15:27.383 --> 00:15:29.650
Buttons.

262
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.320
A button is a button.

263
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.361
That's very self-descriptive
in this particular case.

264
00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:35.613
Kinda hard to forget that one.

265
00:15:35.613 --> 00:15:41.044
Buttons in themselves do not do
anything out of the box, right?

266
00:15:41.044 --> 00:15:43.839
You don't put a button on the page and
it just suddenly does something.

267
00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:47.604
So usually this is for,
it's a hook for JavaScript, right?

268
00:15:47.604 --> 00:15:51.045
You put a button on the page and
people know how to click buttons,

269
00:15:51.045 --> 00:15:55.012
it's one of those that you look at,
you instantly know what to do with it.

270
00:15:55.012 --> 00:16:00.333
And then you'll use JavaScript to respond
to a user clicking a button, right?

271
00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.761
So you put a button on a page and
then you,

272
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:07.353
later you'll attach JavaScript to it
to make it do something when clicked.

273
00:16:07.353 --> 00:16:11.038
That make sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes?

274
00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:14.855
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You make it look more nicer,

275
00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:16.739
is it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll talk about it in

276
00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:18.001
the CSS section.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

277
00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:20.838
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

278
00:16:20.838 --> 00:16:22.541
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you add anything for

279
00:16:22.541 --> 00:16:26.533
accessibility within the button tag?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, you don't actually

280
00:16:26.533 --> 00:16:29.833
have to which is really nice, that's
another good reason you use a button tag.

281
00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:31.213
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

282
00:16:31.213 --> 00:16:32.012
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is that screen

283
00:16:32.012 --> 00:16:36.540
reader already know for look a buttons,
cuz they know it's really important and

284
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.547
that's how you interact the site.

285
00:16:38.547 --> 00:16:41.269
I'm happy you bring that up
because you can actually,

286
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:43.468
there's no reason you
have to use a button.

287
00:16:43.468 --> 00:16:46.676
You can put a div there, and
you can make it work the same way.

288
00:16:46.676 --> 00:16:50.994
But a screen reader would not find a div
because a screen reader is not looking

289
00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:51.613
for divs.

290
00:16:51.613 --> 00:16:53.920
So that's another good
reason to use buttons,

291
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.756
because screen readers already
know what to do with them.

292
00:16:56.756 --> 00:17:00.391
Good question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other questions?

293
00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:05.766
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

294
00:17:07.024 --> 00:17:08.091
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's just go up here in

295
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:08.721
just a second so

296
00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:13.592
you can see what a button looks like.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Button.

297
00:17:16.908 --> 00:17:17.716
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Click me.

298
00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:20.389
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you don't

299
00:17:20.389 --> 00:17:23.348
do anything,
the button just looks like this, right?

300
00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:26.931
It looks very clickable,
it's something that, when you click on it,

301
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:28.732
it depresses a little bit, right?

302
00:17:28.732 --> 00:17:31.515
So out of the box it already
looks like a button,

303
00:17:31.515 --> 00:17:36.976
it looks like something you can click.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Later,

304
00:17:36.976 --> 00:17:39.917
we'll be able to see like how to style
it different, make it look different,

305
00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:41.566
make it look nicer, and things like that.

306
00:17:41.566 --> 00:17:45.349
But-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Also, you kinda wanna keep

307
00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:49.707
this aesthetic, mostly, because that's
what people expect when they're looking

308
00:17:49.707 --> 00:17:53.230
for buttons, and you wanna make
your site as intuitive as possible.
