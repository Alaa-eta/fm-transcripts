00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:01.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about HTML so
far?

2
00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:09.282
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So actually,
if you put the slash at the end of input,

3
00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:11.575
you have a space before it?

4
00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:15.012
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I think that's
just a stylistic preference.

5
00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:16.421
I think that's technically fine.

6
00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:19.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You don't need it.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.271
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't need it,
yeah, I always put it there.

8
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:25.993
I don't know if I have a good reason,
habit I suppose.

9
00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:29.666
[LAUGH] That's a good question, yeah.

10
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:34.138
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So for best practices,
should you use the closing slash or

11
00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:38.344
skip it or
is that really just stylistic preferences?

12
00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:41.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think it's
a question of stylistic preference,

13
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:44.059
I used to not ever put the slash.

14
00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.677
And then I started writing React,
with React specifically

15
00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:53.493
which is not the same as writing HTML,
but React requires it.

16
00:00:53.493 --> 00:00:58.326
So that's why I got back in
the habit of putting it again, so

17
00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:00.853
up to you I think is the answer.

18
00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:01.363
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

19
00:01:01.363 --> 00:01:05.777
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question,
anyone else, yes?

20
00:01:05.777 --> 00:01:10.629
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In your example where you
have the word hi, you have the hi on

21
00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:15.400
a separate line from H1, and
the closing bracket on H1.

22
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.060
Does it have to be on a separate line?

23
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.197
Or can they all be on one single line,
all the H1 opening and closing?

24
00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:27.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I like that question,
thank you very much.

25
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.381
You can definitely do this, right?

26
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:33.493
Is that your question?

27
00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.394
This is totally valid HTML.

28
00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.267
This will go through a browser and
it will work perfectly.

29
00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:41.901
This is very hard to read [LAUGH].

30
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:46.892
So, the white space is what's this called?

31
00:01:49.728 --> 00:01:53.174
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I go back to here
like this, this white space here.

32
00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:56.814
So all these spaces and int returns and
things like that is meaningless.

33
00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:58.623
It doesn't actually do anything.

34
00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:02.485
It's purely for you as the programmer
to make it more readable for you.

35
00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:06.486
So this is far less dense, so it's easy
for the eye to like peruse very quickly,

36
00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:08.596
which is ultimately what I'm going for.

37
00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:12.840
So even though like there's
a bunch of space here,

38
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.663
you'll notice that there's no space before
this HTML cuts off all of that space.

39
00:02:19.663 --> 00:02:22.153
So, that's a good,
does that answer your questions?

40
00:02:22.153 --> 00:02:27.470
Cool, so it's purely for you.

41
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.638
Other questions?

42
00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:30.837
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have one more question.

43
00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:32.533
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So what is diff and

44
00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:33.859
when do you use it?

45
00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.174
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll get to it,
just a second.

46
00:02:35.174 --> 00:02:38.414
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question, yeah?

47
00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:43.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So when I do
the first H1 and I type in, say H5,

48
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.196
it seems to input into the result,
the H5 and

49
00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:52.481
it does highlight the second H1 in red.

50
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:53.098
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's like this?

51
00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:56.707
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: But
it lets me do that, yeah, is that?

52
00:02:56.707 --> 00:02:58.995
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question,
like what's happening here?

53
00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:00.796
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

54
00:03:00.796 --> 00:03:01.316
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: HTML and

55
00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:05.263
browsers in particular are very
good at dealing with bad HTML.

56
00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:10.231
Because we have decades of bad programmers
behind us, and good programmers,

57
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:11.976
but also bad programmers.

58
00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:13.872
This used to be called quirks mode.

59
00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:18.002
Anyone that had to deal with
quirks mode will probably

60
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.671
get a little bit of PTSD right now.

61
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:25.459
But the short answer to it is I don't
actually know how it's going to

62
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.471
handle this.

63
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:29.046
But the browser is very resilient and

64
00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:32.379
it will try to recover
from mistakes like that.

65
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.061
So this being read right here it
just has a syntax highlighter on it.

66
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:39.843
That's why this is green and
this is black.

67
00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:46.063
So that's the syntax highlighter breaking,
that's why it's red right there.

68
00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:49.824
This looks like it's in H,
actually being rendered as an H5.

69
00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:52.579
Yeah, so
it looks like this is respecting the H5,

70
00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.695
which means that Firefox in this
particular case is respecting it as an H5.

71
00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:01.721
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question though.

72
00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:09.802
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I think the sum of
the story is that the browser will do its

73
00:04:09.802 --> 00:04:10.736
best to recover.

74
00:04:12.963 --> 00:04:14.621
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And actually,
it does a pretty good job.

75
00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:20.373
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any other questions?

76
00:04:28.188 --> 00:04:35.091
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there are, I looked
it up, did I put how many there are?

77
00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:38.253
We're gonna go over some of the more
important ones right here, but

78
00:04:45.773 --> 00:04:48.818
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's some 300-odd tags,

79
00:04:48.818 --> 00:04:51.863
I think there's 350ish tags.

80
00:04:51.863 --> 00:04:54.977
But you definitely,definitely, definitely
do not need to know all of them.

81
00:04:54.977 --> 00:04:57.284
I don't know all of them,
I probably don't even know half.

82
00:04:57.284 --> 00:04:59.368
I guarantee you I don't
even know half of them.

83
00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:03.386
You probably, I guess fifty at the most.

84
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:08.065
There's probably like one to thirty
that you use really well like a lot.

85
00:05:08.065 --> 00:05:12.617
Like thirty to fifty of them
that you use sometimes and

86
00:05:12.617 --> 00:05:15.157
the rest you use never [LAUGH].

87
00:05:15.157 --> 00:05:19.148
And there's a certain amount of them that
they're like depricated is the word that

88
00:05:19.148 --> 00:05:20.241
we would use for that.

89
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:23.449
Which is they used to exist and
they are no longer in use,

90
00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.857
and you are discouraged from using them.

91
00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:28.238
So there's a bunch of those as well.

92
00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:31.190
HTML is how old?

93
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.506
Like 30 years old or
something like that, maybe longer.

94
00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:40.443
And when they were designing
the how to use HTML 30 years ago,

95
00:05:40.443 --> 00:05:44.618
they did not know how we were going
to be using and abusing it today.

96
00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:47.901
So they could never have predicted things
that were going to be good ideas and

97
00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:49.608
things that were going to be bad ideas.

98
00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:54.214
That's why we're on HTML 5.1 right now,
which just means we're on

99
00:05:54.214 --> 00:05:59.307
the 5th major revision of and the .1
they added a couple more things as well.

100
00:05:59.307 --> 00:06:03.222
So, there's a bunch of stuff
that has changed over the years.

101
00:06:03.222 --> 00:06:08.446
So, we'll get a bit more
into that later as well.

102
00:06:08.446 --> 00:06:11.377
So now we're gonna, we'll talk about
divs here in just a second, but

103
00:06:11.377 --> 00:06:14.871
we're gonna explore a bunch of different
kinds of tags that you should know about.

104
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:18.882
These are, I would deem to be
some of the more useful ones.

105
00:06:18.882 --> 00:06:26.909
So we talked about H1 through H6
which are headers or headings rather.

106
00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:30.445
So like this one for example is an H1, or

107
00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:35.238
no this an H2 I think,
right here, this type of tags.

108
00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:37.352
So that's gonna be some sort
of heading on the page,

109
00:06:37.352 --> 00:06:39.573
like something that you would
have at the top, right?

110
00:06:39.573 --> 00:06:42.013
That's gonna be some sort of title,

111
00:06:42.013 --> 00:06:46.511
some sort of important descriptor
that you want kinda to stand out.

112
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:49.769
That's why this one's bigger,
it's bolder, it's a heading, right?

113
00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:52.794
You're scrolling down like, what you're
doing if you come to this page and

114
00:06:52.794 --> 00:06:54.368
you just wanna peruse it really quick.

115
00:06:54.368 --> 00:06:56.970
You're gonna scroll down really quick and
you're just gonna look at headings, right?

116
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.661
That's kinda what they're for.

117
00:07:01.596 --> 00:07:03.436
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
that's why you have H1 through H6.

118
00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:05.693
On this particular page, this basic HTML,

119
00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:08.745
that's the H1 because that's
the most important thing.

120
00:07:08.745 --> 00:07:13.355
This entire page is about basic HTML,
okay?

121
00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:20.149
And then everything underneath is
H2s are kind of sub-headings here.

122
00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:25.383
In sequence, scroll down look at types
of tags and those sorts of things.

123
00:07:25.383 --> 00:07:30.997
And then if this had headings then it
would have an H3, so on and so forth.

124
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.762
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
just to kind of highlight it,

125
00:07:36.762 --> 00:07:40.654
like a bunch of these are kind of
like they're pretty squishy subjects.

126
00:07:40.654 --> 00:07:44.075
So there's not like necessarily
the right way to do it.

127
00:07:44.075 --> 00:07:47.600
I kinda likened it to formatting
in Microsoft Word Document.

128
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.116
There's multiple ways to do this.

129
00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:53.074
It as much artistic license
as it is in Engineering.

130
00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:56.232
Which you're gonna find a lot
throughout this courses.

131
00:07:56.232 --> 00:07:59.420
A lot of this is just
kind of doing your best.

132
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.650
Like taking the notes that you have
an applying it the best way you know how,

133
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.990
that makes sense?

134
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.388
Any questions?

135
00:08:10.388 --> 00:08:17.124
Cool, P tags, P stands for paragraph and

136
00:08:17.124 --> 00:08:25.216
you'll put paragraphs of
text inside of a P tags.

137
00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:30.340
So like up here, this right here,
that little bit, that is a P tag, right?

138
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.952
It's just a paragraph.

139
00:08:32.952 --> 00:08:36.276
And so, if you have multiple
paragraphs next to each other, right?

140
00:08:36.276 --> 00:08:38.270
This is multiple P tags right here.

141
00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:42.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's what it is,

142
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.875
it's just whatever you put
inside of a paragraph.

143
00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:49.152
So you're gonna use P tags quite a bit.

144
00:08:49.152 --> 00:08:52.905
So only text goes inside of P tags.

145
00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:55.923
So for example,
you can't have a div inside a P tag or

146
00:08:55.923 --> 00:08:59.915
you can't have an H1 inside a P tag,
only tags end up going in there.

147
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:05.170
And some sort of spans can go in there,
things that describe text.

148
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.881
Which we'll get to spans in just a second.

149
00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:11.341
But there's a bunch of things that
we cannot go inside of a P tag.

150
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:14.673
And what the browser will actually do if
you try to put something inside of there,

151
00:09:14.673 --> 00:09:15.906
it will actually kick it out.

152
00:09:15.906 --> 00:09:22.947
So it looks really weird, so
don't put weird things in there [LAUGH].

153
00:09:22.947 --> 00:09:29.401
Anchor tags, so that's an A,
these are links, right?

154
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:34.224
Where A gonna stands for anchor,
I can't remember why it stands for

155
00:09:34.224 --> 00:09:38.961
anchor like I don't know why that's
the appropriate term for it,

156
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:41.426
it's just what you call it [LAUGH].

157
00:09:41.426 --> 00:09:43.116
So like this right here,

158
00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:47.138
this link right here where you
like put your pointer over and

159
00:09:47.138 --> 00:09:52.537
it turns to a cursor so you can click on
it, that is an anchor tag, that is a link.

160
00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:59.473
So if you look here, so you have the &lt;a
href=frontendmasters.com&gt;, right?

161
00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:03.651
So this href is where it actually
ends up going, where the,

162
00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:09.013
that needs another quotation mark
right there, whatever, that's fine.

163
00:10:09.013 --> 00:10:10.495
Then this is the text inside of it.

164
00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:14.361
So you can see here this link
actually doesn't go anywhere, but

165
00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:16.088
that's what it looks like.

166
00:10:16.088 --> 00:10:19.953
So you use A tags to create links, right?

167
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.833
And you would link it to some other URL.

168
00:10:24.884 --> 00:10:31.423
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: URL stands for
uniform resource location, I think.

169
00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:34.903
It's like whatever the address is,
the web address.

170
00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:38.837
So you can see up here, this is the web
address for this particular page.

171
00:10:38.837 --> 00:10:41.703
That's what would go inside
of here instead of the href.

172
00:10:41.703 --> 00:10:43.750
You would put it in there and

173
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.656
then the link would take you to
that place, does that make sense?

174
00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:52.896
Okay, I'm seeing mostly head nods,
so I feel pretty good about that.

175
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That href, this part
right here, is called an attribute, and

176
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.920
that is in the next lesson.

177
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.846
We'll talk a lot more about attributes.

178
00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:09.982
Basically you can give additional
information to these tags via attributes.

179
00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:15.445
And again, we will go over that,
we actually have a whole section on it,

180
00:11:15.445 --> 00:11:19.762
so if that doesn't make sense right now,
it's coming.

181
00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:25.805
Div, this is one we had a question about,
it is short for division.

182
00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:28.602
And I like to think of
divs as cardboard boxes,

183
00:11:28.602 --> 00:11:33.431
that it's not actually the cardboard
box is never the important part, right?

184
00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:35.254
It's actually what's inside
of the cardboard box.

185
00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:40.085
So it's a box that you stick stuff
in like you stick other more

186
00:11:40.085 --> 00:11:42.653
important things inside of it.

187
00:11:42.653 --> 00:11:46.252
A div in and of itself has no what
we would call semantic meaning.

188
00:11:46.252 --> 00:11:49.591
It doesn't necessarily meaning
anything because it's inside of a div.

189
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:56.631
It's just kind of a no name container that
you put stuff into, does it make sense?

190
00:11:56.631 --> 00:12:02.681
Like it's just, you're gonna use
divs everywhere because there's

191
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:08.843
a lot of times when you can't really
describe anything in particular.

192
00:12:08.843 --> 00:12:12.754
Like, you don't need a tag that
has any sort of semantic meaning.

193
00:12:12.754 --> 00:12:16.269
So its, yeah, a generic tag for
grouping things together.

194
00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:19.682
Divs can be really useful with CSS.

195
00:12:19.682 --> 00:12:23.247
And that's in particular where I will
use them a bunch because they're really

196
00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:24.606
useful for styling with CSS.

197
00:12:24.606 --> 00:12:26.550
So that's why you'll see those a lot.

198
00:12:28.634 --> 00:12:34.907
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you have a blog post
kind of thing, you'll kinda like group

199
00:12:34.907 --> 00:12:40.145
the entire blog post container
into one div usually.

200
00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:44.336
Spans, spans are like sort of like
divs that they're like have no

201
00:12:44.336 --> 00:12:47.763
necessarily semantic meaning in and
of themselves,

202
00:12:47.763 --> 00:12:52.227
but,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There, excuse me.

203
00:12:52.227 --> 00:12:56.604
[SOUND] Okay, so yes, spans if a div is

204
00:12:56.604 --> 00:13:01.657
a cardboard box,
a span is like a Ziploc bag.

205
00:13:01.657 --> 00:13:07.227
It's like a smaller div and you'll
have like spans inside of paragraphs.

206
00:13:07.227 --> 00:13:09.873
So like, if I wanted to highlight
this block of text right there or

207
00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:12.486
something like that,
I would put that inside of a span, right?

208
00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:16.193
So it's actually a small snippet
of whatever you're doing with.

209
00:13:16.193 --> 00:13:18.010
You can have spans really
inside of anything.

210
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.561
You can have them inside of H1s,
you can have them inside of paragraphs,

211
00:13:21.561 --> 00:13:23.699
inside of divs, they fit kind of anywhere.

212
00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:29.257
And it's just like for this small block of
something I'm gonna put a span around it.

213
00:13:29.257 --> 00:13:32.582
I don't actually end up
using them a terrible lot.

214
00:13:32.582 --> 00:13:36.647
It's not usually that I need
to do something like that, but

215
00:13:36.647 --> 00:13:39.509
if I needed to, that's how I would do it.

216
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:43.420
Okay, so OLs and ULs, so OL stands for

217
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.319
order list, and UL stands for
unordered list.

218
00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:53.479
So what you see here, like where I had
this list of tags that I'm talking about,

219
00:13:53.479 --> 00:13:55.264
this is an unordered list.

220
00:13:55.264 --> 00:13:58.201
So it's an unordered list
because I could swap a and p and

221
00:13:58.201 --> 00:14:00.402
it doesn't really make any difference.

222
00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:01.934
It doesn't change the meaning of the list.

223
00:14:01.934 --> 00:14:04.879
It's an unordered list,
it's just a list of stuff and

224
00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:08.030
it doesn't really matter what
order it comes in, right?

225
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.754
So that's why this is an unordered list.

226
00:14:10.754 --> 00:14:13.990
If something was an ordered list,
if I changed the order of it,

227
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.771
it would change the meaning of it.

228
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:17.259
So for an example,

229
00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:22.848
I have here the list of the ten most
popular cities in the world, right?

230
00:14:22.848 --> 00:14:27.329
I can't switch number one and number two
or else that list is now incorrect, right?

231
00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:30.263
So that's when you would use an OL,
an ordered list.

232
00:14:30.263 --> 00:14:34.275
So and instead of here of having bullets
it would numbers like one, two, three,

233
00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:36.761
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

234
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:41.986
So OL is ordered list,
UL is unordered list.

235
00:14:41.986 --> 00:14:45.127
And then all of the individual
elements inside of it, right?

236
00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:50.101
So the span1, the OL1, the button1, right?

237
00:14:50.101 --> 00:14:53.537
These are LI's,
they're list elements, right?

238
00:14:53.537 --> 00:14:58.197
So it's one individual entry inside
of the OL or inside of the UL.

239
00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:00.122
So you can see here, I have an example.

240
00:15:02.272 --> 00:15:06.336
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is a UL, so it would
be an unordered list and the UL ends here.

241
00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:12.384
And I have one LI here, another LI here,
another LI here, right?

242
00:15:12.384 --> 00:15:17.169
So you'll have an opening to UL or
OL and a bunch of LIs' in it, and

243
00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:20.661
then you'll close your UL or
OL just like that.

244
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:21.710
Any questions about that?

245
00:15:24.454 --> 00:15:27.373
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's useful for
making lists of things.

246
00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:31.389
Buttons, a button is a button.

247
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:34.569
It's very self-descriptive
in this particular case.

248
00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:36.712
Kinda hard to forget that one.

249
00:15:36.712 --> 00:15:41.200
Buttons in and of themselves do not
do anything out of the box, right?

250
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.914
You don't put a button on the page and
it just suddenly does something.

251
00:15:43.914 --> 00:15:48.095
So usually, this is for,
it's a hook for JavaScript, right?

252
00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:51.594
It puts a button on the page and
people know how to click buttons.

253
00:15:51.594 --> 00:15:55.473
It's one of those things that you look at,
you instantly know what to do with it.

254
00:15:55.473 --> 00:16:00.374
And then you'll use JavaScript to respond
to a user clicking a button, right?

255
00:16:00.374 --> 00:16:02.486
So you put a button on a page, and

256
00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:07.435
later you'll attach JavaScript to it
to make it do something one clicked.

257
00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:11.130
That make sense, yes?

258
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.583
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: How do you
make it look more nicer?

259
00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:15.880
Is that?

260
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.526
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll talk
about it in the CSS section.

261
00:16:17.526 --> 00:16:19.382
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

262
00:16:19.382 --> 00:16:25.756
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And do you add anything for
accessibility within the button tag?

263
00:16:25.756 --> 00:16:28.028
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, you don't actually
have to, which is really nice.

264
00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:30.002
That's another good reason
to use a button tag.

265
00:16:30.002 --> 00:16:31.216
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay.

266
00:16:31.216 --> 00:16:34.743
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is that screen readers
already know to look for buttons.

267
00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:36.941
Because they know that
they're really important, and

268
00:16:36.941 --> 00:16:38.726
that that's how you
interact with the site.

269
00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:41.684
And I'm happy you're bringing that up,
because you can actually,

270
00:16:41.684 --> 00:16:43.571
there's no reason you
have to use a button.

271
00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:46.856
You could put a div there and
you can make it work the same way.

272
00:16:46.856 --> 00:16:51.098
But a screen reader would not find a div
because a screen reader is not looking

273
00:16:51.098 --> 00:16:51.703
for divs.

274
00:16:51.703 --> 00:16:55.508
So that's another good reason to use
buttons because screen readers already

275
00:16:55.508 --> 00:16:56.806
know what to do with them.

276
00:16:56.806 --> 00:17:00.434
Good question, other questions?

277
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:11.493
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
let's just go up here in just a second,

278
00:17:11.493 --> 00:17:16.807
so you can see what a button looks like,

279
00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:19.557
button, click me.

280
00:17:19.557 --> 00:17:23.321
So if you don't do anything,
the button just looks like this, right?

281
00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:26.778
It looks very clickable,
something like when you click on it,

282
00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:28.748
it depresses a little bit, right?

283
00:17:28.748 --> 00:17:32.652
So, out of the box,
it already looks like a button.

284
00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:36.681
It looks like something you can click.

285
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.319
Later, we'll be able to see
like how to style it different,

286
00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:42.139
make it look different,
make it look nicer or things like that.

287
00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:48.131
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Also, you kinda wanna keep
this aesthetic mostly because that's what

288
00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:51.089
people expect when they're looking for
buttons.

289
00:17:51.089 --> 00:17:53.875
And you wanna make your site
as intuitive as possible.
