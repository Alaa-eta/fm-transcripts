[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: So hopefully you've absorbed a little bit about HTML and count what the uses are. We're pretty much, I feel pretty good about where we are with HTML with how much you've been taught and how much you understand about it. We're going have another brief, maybe ten-minute lesson, more about the meta level of HTML, just like structure and the boring parts of it, if we're being completely honest.

[00:00:28]
And then we're gonna get into some CSS, which will, I think being a little bit more fun, I think. So do we have any questions before we get started?
>> Brian Holt: Cool, obviously everything made perfect sense, that's what I'm taking out of this, cool. So we are on the meta HTML section, section 6.

[00:00:56]

>> Brian Holt: So most of what I've been trying to show you so far is like visual and concrete and things that are a little bit more, it's easy to see like if I change this then I can see this. What we're gonna do now is gonna be a little bit more subtle in like how it affects your documents that you're creating here.

[00:01:16]
So let's just start with the bare bones of basic skeleton of an HTML document. Right now everything we've been doing now is in the confines of these little playgrounds. But that's not usually actually how you write in code. Normally you're in your editor and you're creating like index HTML and it has a bunch of stuff, right?

[00:01:34]
And there's a certain amount of just like base layer stuff that you need. Like the term for that is boiler plate. Do not know why it's called boilder plate. But when someone says boiler plate it means just like this repeated stuff that you always have to have, right?

[00:01:51]
Basically it's like what you copy and paste from the last project to get started on the next project. Cuz we all do it. [LAUGH] And that's okay. I do it every time I start a new project. So this is right here that I have, these ten lines. This is the base layer of what it takes to have a basic HTML document.

[00:02:12]
And we're gonna dissect it line by line so you understand what's going on. So we can see all these ten lines of code, all that comes out of here is Check this out. That's it, which is the H1, right?
>> Brian Holt: But let's talk about the rest of it here.

[00:02:32]
So the doc type HTML, the very very first thing right here.
>> Brian Holt: I was talking about it before, this is HTML 5.1 that you're learning here. HTML 5 has been out for like a decade, I'm gonna guess, it's been out a decent amount of time. It's to the point that HTML 5 is not even a thing that we really say anymore, it's just HTML now, right?

[00:02:55]
That's just kinda the base layer assumption that everything is HTML now. So the reason why we have this thing right here is we need to let the browser know we're doing HTML 5. We're doing the latest version of HTML, and that's what this thing right here, the DOCTYPE as it's called.

[00:03:13]
You can give it other DOCTYPE headers to use older versions, but I do not understand why you would ever want to do that to yourself. But there's strict HTML blah blah blah, I can't remember what they are because it's been so long since I've worked with it. It's been literally since the beginning of my first job that I've done anything else besides DOCTYPE html.

[00:03:35]
And they look more or less all like this. It does have to be literally the first line of the code. You can't even do a space here, it has to be literally the first line. So that always should be there. The next thing that you're gonna have is this HTML tag that's closed down here.

[00:03:57]

>> Brian Holt: That's just everything that goes inside of your HTML tag. That's just the way that works. It's letting you know the beginning and the ending of your doc. And then it's gonna have this lang=en, en as you may have guessed, stands for English. And you're just letting the browser know, it's like hey, I'm sending an English document down.

[00:04:18]
You could put es there, which would be Spanish. Like you would send whatever language you're putting that in there so that the browser knows. It's like, cool, you're about to receive Japanese. Be prepared to receive Japanese, that kinda stuff, right?
>> Brian Holt: Also, just as a side note, your browser has a language that's set for it.

[00:04:39]
It's usually set by, I downloaded this browser in America, it just assumed that I want to speak English and it assumes that I will change it if I don't wanna speak English. So my browser's actually requesting English from wherever website I go to, and then it's receiving English back.

[00:04:55]
So, that's done through headers, which we will talk about headers in a little bit. But basically it's meta information that I'm sending from my browser saying hey, do you have any English documents? And then it sends back. And with this it says yes, here's your English document. So again, we'll get more into headers later in the course.

[00:05:16]
So that's what the HTML lang equals that. Okay, we're gonna talk about head here for a second, which is this one right here. Now keep in mind that there is a header and a head, and they are different. So we're talking about head at this moment in time, just so you know.

[00:05:34]
Every HTML document has a head and has a body. And in the head goes all the meta information about your document. So in this particular case, we're just putting the title. And the title is like if you Google something and the, what's the, well, let's just Google something.

[00:05:55]
If I Google Front end masters,
>> Brian Holt: So this part right here is what's in their title, right? So it's the title of the document. That's what goes in title. It's also if I click on this it's gonna be what's up here in the tab. So it's also what goes right there, right?

[00:06:18]
That is the title.
>> Brian Holt: That's weird, I've been watching myself. [LAUGH] Okay so that's where the title goes in there. You should call whatever the document is like this one is called Intro to Web Dev V2. It makes sense so when someone navigates to some other tab it's like okay there's by Web Dev document I'm just gonna click back on that one.

[00:06:41]
So that should always be there. There are lots of other things that can go in head. You can configure the viewport, for example. So the viewport is,
>> Brian Holt: How do I wanna explain that? If I'm on a mobile phone do I want the website to shrink to the size of the phone?

[00:07:00]
Or do I want it to continue like so they have to scroll side-to-side to see the whole thing? You can configure those sorts of things inside of the head. It's just like the meta information that the user doesn't necessarily see but still needs to be configured. That stuff all goes in head.

[00:07:15]
All of your CSS Links all go in the head as well. There's some other things as well.
>> Brian Holt: So basically if it's a thing that's not shown to the user but it's used to configure your website, those sorts of things go in the head. Any questions about head?

[00:07:34]
It's kind of a nebulous, I know.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, body. So the things that go in body is what we've been writing so far, it's all your divs, spans, etc., etc., right? All that stuff is going in your body, that's the stuff that people are going to see. So it's where our H1 went.

[00:07:57]
I put a comment in there, Yeah.
>> Brian Holt: And then that is like, this is the bare minimum stuff that you need to run a website.
>> Brian Holt: There's actually a couple other things that probably should be in there, but we're ignoring for now, which is okay.
>> Brian Holt: Cool. So the last thing I want to talk about are script, style and link.

[00:08:30]

>> Brian Holt: So script is how you link JavaScript files into your HTML. It's cuz your HTML and your JavaScript files are gonna be separate files. You're not gonna put them together, you're gonna separate them. And believe me, it's gonna end up being better. So that's gonna be linked in via a script tag.

[00:08:49]
And it's the same thing with link. Link is how you bring in all of your CSS. And again, your CSS is gonna live in a different file, and you're gonna be brought in via a link tag. Today we're gonna be using a lot of style tags, just because I want you to be able to see your HTML and your CSS at the same time and be able to edit them.

[00:09:09]
That's not typically how you're gonna do things. You're typically gonna have a link tag with a separate CSS file that's gonna be brought in. But just for today, just for demonstration purposes we're to be using style tags. So we'll get more into that when we kinda get there, but just so you know this is a typical, you definitely do not want to use style tags normally.

[00:09:30]
So what a style tag is that you can actually put CSS inside of the style tag and it will work. We'll see what that looks like in the next section. So any questions about this meta HTML? It's kind of, again, nebulous because it's hard to visualize. So it's one of those things that you just kinda have to do it and then forget that you do it, and that's fine.

[00:09:56]
[LAUGH] Cuz normally you don't have to change it very much.
>> Speaker 2: What does meta mean?
>> Brian Holt: What does meta mean?
>> Speaker 2: Yeah.
>> Brian Holt: How do I wanna explain that? That's a good question.
>> Brian Holt: In this particular case I'm not gonna define that cuz I'm probably not gonna get it right, but in this particular case it means something that you're doing that's not necessarily going to be displayed on the page.

[00:10:30]
It's not necessarily going to have an immediate concrete effect. So like if I change what the title is, it's not going to change the way my page looks, but it's still affecting my page and probably more subtle ways that changes the way the page is like works, right?

[00:10:48]
Like if I changed the DOCTYPE it would change the way that the page was rendered, it would use another rendering engine underneath it, which would change like how things were laid out and what colors and. I don't know, things of that nature, so they're more subtle changes. So it's a sufficiently vague answer.

[00:11:07]
[LAUGH] It's kind of difficult to define, but I mean, it's a good question.
>> Speaker 2: Thank you.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, of course.
