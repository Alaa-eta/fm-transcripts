[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: So hopefully you've absorbed a little bit about HTML and kind of what the uses are. I feel pretty good about where we are with HTML and how much you've been taught and much you understand about it. We're gonna have another just brief, maybe ten-minute lesson, kind of more about the meta level of HTML, just kinda like structure and kinda the boring parts of it, if we're being completely honest.

[00:00:28]
And then we're gonna get into some CSS which shall start, I think, being a little bit more fun, I think. Does anybody have any questions before we get started?
>> Brian Holt: Cool, obviously everything made perfect sense. That's what I'm taking out of of this. Cool, so we are on the Meta HTML section, section 6.

[00:00:56]

>> Brian Holt: So most of what I've been trying to show you so far is visual and concrete and things that are a little bit more, it's easy to see. If I change this, then I can see this. What we're gonna do now is gonna be a little bit more subtle in how it affects your documents that you're creating here.

[00:01:16]
So let's just start with the bare bones, basic skeleton of an HTML document. Right now everything we've been doing has just kinda been in the confines of these little playgrounds, right? But that's not usually how you're writing code, right? Normally you're in your editor and you're creating like index.html and it has a bunch of stuff, right?

[00:01:34]
And there's a certain amount of just base layer stuff that you need. The term for that is boilerplate. Do not know why it's called boilerplate. But when someone says boilerplate it means just this repeated stuff that you just kind of always have to have, right? Basically it's what you copy and paste from the last project to get started on the next project.

[00:01:56]
Cuz we all do it, [LAUGH] and that's okay. I do it every time I start a new project. So this is right here that I have these ten lines. This is the base layer of what it takes to have a basic HTML document. We're gonna dissect it line by line so you understand what's going on.

[00:02:18]
So you can see all these ten lines of code, all that comes out of here is Check this out. That's it, it's the h1, right? But let's talk about the rest of it here. So the DOCTYPE html and the very, very first thing right here.
>> Brian Holt: I was talking about it before.

[00:02:40]
This is HTML 5.1 that you're learning here. HTML 5 has been out for a decade, I'm gonna guess. It's been out a decent amount of time. It's to the point that HTML 5 is not even a thing that we really say anymore, it's just HTML now, right? That's just kind of the base layer assumption that everything is HTML now.

[00:03:00]
So the reason why we have this thing right here is we need to let the browser know we're doing HTML 5. We're doing the latest version of HTML and that's what this thing right here, the DOCTYPE, as it's called. You can give it other DOCTYPE headers to use older versions, but I do not understand why you would ever want to do that to yourself.

[00:03:21]
But there's strict HTML blah, blah, blah. I can't remember what they are, because it's been so long since I've worked with it. It's been literally since the beginning of my first job that I've done anything else besides DOCTYPE HTML. And they look more or less all like this.

[00:03:37]
It does have to be literally the first line of the code. You can't even do a space here. It has to be literally the first line. So that always should be there. The next thing that you're gonna have is this html tag that's closed down here. That's just everything goes inside of your html tag.

[00:04:00]
That's just like the way that works. It's letting you know the beginning and the ending of your doc. And then it's gonna have this lang="en". en, as you may have guessed, stands for English. And you're just letting the browser know, hey, I'm sending an English document down. You can put es there which would be Spanish.

[00:04:22]
You would send whatever language you're putting that in there so that the browser knows, cool, you're about to receive Japanese. Be prepared to receive Japanese, that kind of stuff, right? Also just kinda as a side note, your browser has a language that's set for it. I downloaded this browser in America, it just assumes that I wanna speak English.

[00:04:45]
And it assumes that I will change it if I don't wanna speak English. So my browser is actually requesting English from wherever website I go to, and then it's receiving English back. So that's done through headers, which we will talk about headers in a little bit. But basically it's meta information that I'm sending from my browser saying, hey, do you have any English documents?

[00:05:06]
And then it sends back with this and says, yes, here is your English document. So again, we'll get more into headers later in the course. So that's what the html lang= that. Okay, we're gonna talk about head here for a second which is this one right here. Now keep in mind that there is a header and a head and they are different.

[00:05:29]
So we're talking about head at this moment in time, just so you know. Every HTML document has a head and it has a body. And in the head goes all the meta information about your document. So in this particular case, we're just putting the title. And the title is if you Google something, and let's just Google something.

[00:05:55]
If I Google Frontend Masters, so this part right here is what's in their title, right? So it's the title of the document. That's what goes in title. It's also if I click on this, notice when I click on it, it's gonna be what's up here in the tab.

[00:06:15]
So it's also what goes right there, right? That is the title.
>> Brian Holt: That's weird, I've been watching myself. [LAUGH] Okay, so that's what the title goes in there. You should call it whatever the name of the document is. This one's called Intro to Web Dev V2. That make sense?

[00:06:35]
So that when someone navigates to another tab, he's like, okay, there's my Web Dev document. I'm just gonna click back on that one. So that should always be there. There are lots of other things that can go in head. You can configure the viewport, for example. So the viewport is, how do I wanna explain that?

[00:06:55]
If I'm on a mobile phone, do I want the website to shrink to the size of the phone or do I want to continue so they have to scroll side to side to see the whole thing? You can configure those sorts of thing inside of the head. It's just the meta information that the user doesn't necessarily see but still needs to be configured.

[00:07:13]
That stuff all goes in head. All of your CSS links all go in the head as well. There's some other things as well. So basically if it's a thing that's not shown to the user but it's used to configure your website, those sorts of things go in the head.

[00:07:33]
Any questions about head? It's kind of nebulous, I know.
>> Brian Holt: Okay.
>> Brian Holt: So the things that go in body is what we've been writing so far. It's all your divs, spans, etc., etc., right? All that stuff is gonna go inside your body. That's the stuff that people are going to see.

[00:07:55]
So that's where our h1 went. I put a comment in there, yeah.
>> Brian Holt: And then that is like, this is the bare minimum stuff they need to run a website.
>> Brian Holt: There's actually a couple other things that probably should be in there, but we're kind of ignoring for now, which is okay.

[00:08:21]

>> Brian Holt: Cool, so last thing I wanna talk about are script, style and link. So script is how you link JavaScript files into your HTML. Cuz your HTML and your JavaScript files are gonna be separate files. You're not gonna put them together, you're gonna separate them, and believe me it's gonna end up being better.

[00:08:46]
So that's gonna be linked in via script tag. It's the same thing with link. Link is how you bring in all of your CSS. And again, your CSS is gonna live in a different file and you're going to be brought in via link tag. Today we're gonna be using a lot of style tags, just because I want you to be able to see your HTML and your CSS at the same time and be able to edit them.

[00:09:09]
That's not typically how you're gonna do things. You're typically gonna have a link tag with a separate CSS file that's gonna be brought in. But just for today, just for demonstration purposes, we'll be using style tags. So we'll get more into that when we kind of get there, but just so you know this is atypical, you definitely do not wanna use style tags normally.

[00:09:30]
So what style tag is, you can actually put CSS inside of the style tag and it will work. We'll see what that looks like in the next section. So any questions about kind of this meta HTML? It's kind of, again, nebulous because it's hard to visualize. [LAUGH] So it's one of those things that you just kinda have to do it.

[00:09:55]
And then you forgot that you do it, and that's fine. [LAUGH] Cuz normally you don't have to change it very much.
>> Student: What does meta mean?
>> Brian Holt: What does meta mean?
>> Student: Yeah.
>> Brian Holt: How do I wanna explain that? It's a good question.
>> Brian Holt: In this particular case, I'm not gonna define meta cuz I'm probably not gonna get it right.

[00:10:22]
But in this particular case, it means something that you are doing that's not necessarily going to be displayed on the page. It's not necessarily going to have like an immediate concrete effect. If I change the title, it's not gonna change the way that my page looks. But it's still affecting my page in probably more subtle ways.

[00:10:45]
It changes the way the pages work. So if I changed the DOCTYPE, it would change the way that the page was rendered. It would use a different rendering engine underneath it, which would change how things were laid out, and what colors, and I don't know, things of that nature, so they're more subtle changes.

[00:11:05]

>> Brian Holt: Is that a sufficiently vague answer? [LAUGH] It's kind of difficult to define, but I mean, it's a good question.
>> Student: Thank you.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, of course.
