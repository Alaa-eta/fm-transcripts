WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.582
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I gave you
here this Code Pen, so

2
00:00:01.582 --> 00:00:04.787
Code Pen is a web site that I just
kinda hold near and dear to my heart.

3
00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:06.310
I think most web developers do.

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.289
It's kinda like the playground they give
you, but it's even more elaborate and

5
00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.170
has more things.

6
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.243
So what I would actually invite you to
do is click this edit on Code Pen right

7
00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:19.225
here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna open this

8
00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:19.858
website for you.

9
00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:23.570
You can kinda just ignore the JS part
cuz we're not doing any JS right

10
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.403
now.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

11
00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:34.967
you can see here I did a bunch of HTML.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

12
00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:39.079
h1, h2, h1, a bunch of CSS over

13
00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.280
here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To affect that.

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.999
And then you can see down here, it's like
what that actually ends up looking like?

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.202
So, I would say just like,
play with it till your hearts content, and

16
00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:56.519
I'll kinda steps through of how these
things are working, what they and

17
00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.613
yeah why.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

18
00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:05.481
this h1 right here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: First thing I want

19
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:06.695
you to point out.

20
00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:10.644
Cuz there's an h1 here and
there's another one right there, and

21
00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:12.910
I have an h1 select right here.

22
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.572
So it affects both of them no matter
where they are on the page, right?

23
00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:22.296
Cuz it matches like, anytime this is an
h1, then apply these things, make sense?

24
00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:26.019
So that's why this one is
equally affected as this one.

25
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:32.387
Cuz they both match the rule, cuz the rule
can be matched multiple times, okay?

26
00:01:32.387 --> 00:01:37.523
Font family, this is a font right,
so the font is how the font looks,

27
00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:42.395
you can see that this font looks
different than this one, right,

28
00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:44.989
they're using different fonts.

29
00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:49.972
Font could also be called a typeset, or
something like that, is anyone confused

30
00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:55.032
by the word font?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

31
00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:58.254
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Color red,

32
00:01:58.254 --> 00:02:03.199
font size 50 pixels, quite large,
and then text-align right.

33
00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:05.705
So you can see here that it's
being pushed over to the right,

34
00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:07.440
that's what that text align right does.

35
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.871
It says move this all
the way to the right side of

36
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:13.798
the page.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then we go down to

37
00:02:13.798 --> 00:02:19.848
the h2 where it says this is the h2.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Font family,

38
00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:23.600
Monaco, Monaco is a monospaced font.

39
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.838
And what all that means is that every
character is exactly the same width.

40
00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:34.320
Whereas you look this one, this i is
not nearly as wide as this h, right,

41
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.090
the h is far wider.

42
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.036
Whereas Monaco, everyone of this is
exactly the same width it's monospace,

43
00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:47.346
that's what that means.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The color is sea green,

44
00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:51.531
you can see that's a nice tealish color.

45
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:55.610
Font size 40 pixels, you can see
it's slightly smaller than this one.

46
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.734
The border is 9 pixels dotted gray, so you
can see here there are dots on the side,

47
00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:04.378
there's also dashed.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

48
00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:07.468
there's also double, I think is one.

49
00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:10.382
So there's a bunch of different kinda
border styles that you can use.

50
00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:14.425
I'll be honest, I think really the only
one that I ever use is solid, but

51
00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:18.417
just you know they're out there,
there's a bunch of stuff out there.

52
00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:23.885
And then text-align: center, so you're
curious and you might be noticing it's

53
00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:28.976
like, well I have this h2 and the border
goes all the way to the edge, right.

54
00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:33.072
That's because these h1's
will take the entire line,

55
00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:37.096
unless you tell them not to,
they take the entire line.

56
00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:41.461
We'll get to how to tell them
to not take the entire line, but

57
00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:46.955
by default divs take the whole line,
h1s through h6 takes the whole line.

58
00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:50.870
Paragraphs take the whole line,
that's just what they do.

59
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.456
Unless you, again,
instruct them otherwise which we'll get

60
00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:58.365
there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, paragraph, so

61
00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:02.051
we go under the paragraph,
font-family: Comic Sans,

62
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:06.837
everyone's favorite font I would say.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are the font family

63
00:04:06.837 --> 00:04:10.887
standard from computer to computer

64
00:04:10.887 --> 00:04:15.837
whether you're on a Mac or is it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The answer to that

65
00:04:15.837 --> 00:04:20.137
question is yes and no,
as any good question should be answered.

66
00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:22.640
There are a handful that
you can pretty well rely,

67
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.130
like every computer has Arial on it,
every computer has Helvetica on it.

68
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.378
Only Mac has San Francisco on it,
for example, so if you're on a Mac,

69
00:04:31.378 --> 00:04:37.314
there's a thing called font book.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

70
00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:41.090
you can see on here,
like these are the web fonts.

71
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.802
Like, if something, I don't know what
the equivalent is on Windows for

72
00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:48.361
this but this happens to exist for Mac.

73
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:50.522
Like every computer has
Times New Roman on it, so

74
00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:53.220
there's certain things that
you can depend on being there.

75
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.750
There's, whereas like I think, Monaco,
I'm not sure you can depend on

76
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.188
tapping on every computer.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So what if you wanna use

77
00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:06.915
a font that you're not guaranteed is
gonna be on somebody's computer then,

78
00:05:06.915 --> 00:05:10.946
how does that work?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My first answer to that

79
00:05:10.946 --> 00:05:15.910
question is don't [LAUGH]
I know I'm a jerk.

80
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.645
[LAUGH] My second answer to that question
is it is possible, there is a thing called

81
00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:24.703
Web Fonts, where you can basically
include fonts from Google usually.

82
00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:29.139
Google has a thing where you can just
include their fonts on their page, but

83
00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.910
usually it's unnecessary.

84
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.224
Usually you can say, like well you're
trying to use this like super impact,

85
00:05:36.224 --> 00:05:41.486
MS font, just use Helvetica and
code today or something like that, right?

86
00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:44.356
Usually you can just switch to something
out to not really sacrifice to which in

87
00:05:44.356 --> 00:05:45.880
way of design.

88
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.748
And the reason why is I say that is
those fonts usually end up being

89
00:05:49.748 --> 00:05:53.474
several hundred kilobytes,
which adds a lot of page weight,

90
00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:56.405
which in my opinion is not worth it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Tell that to

91
00:05:56.405 --> 00:05:57.830
the designer.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I know,

92
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.858
I've been telling them for years, [LAUGH]
and I will be telling them for years.

93
00:06:01.858 --> 00:06:03.848
[LAUGH] Does that answer your question?

94
00:06:03.848 --> 00:06:09.332
Okay, cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

95
00:06:09.332 --> 00:06:15.523
a bunch of these that I'm showing you are,
well like Comic Sans on every computer,

96
00:06:15.523 --> 00:06:20.395
not that you should do anything in
Comic Sans, [LAUGH] but you can.

97
00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:25.995
So that's why you can see here it's that
font size 30 pixels, background black, so

98
00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:31.225
that's why it's black and then the color
is white, that's why it's on there.

99
00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:33.962
And then you can see in here
that I have some spans in here,

100
00:06:33.962 --> 00:06:39.142
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if you go down to span,

101
00:06:39.142 --> 00:06:43.704
you can see that I have yellow
underline in italic and

102
00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:48.992
you can see just that text that
is inside the span is yellow and

103
00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.190
underlined and italic.

104
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.416
So that's what spans do,
they do specific blocks of text.

105
00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:02.275
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Div.

106
00:07:04.198 --> 00:07:05.809
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can see here that I

107
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:09.684
did color blue and
then inside of the div there's an h3.

108
00:07:09.684 --> 00:07:15.640
But the selector says div color
blue that h3 is still blue.

109
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.251
So that's how I got that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then

110
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:26.332
if you go down to the ol.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see here there is

111
00:07:26.332 --> 00:07:32.260
a thing called list style and there
are several ways of doing list styles.

112
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.024
So in this case I'm doing
Roman numeral numbering.

113
00:07:35.024 --> 00:07:40.098
Roman numeral numbering, but
you can also do, well, if I just get rid

114
00:07:40.098 --> 00:07:45.185
of it It will go back to being numbers
cuz that's what it is by default.

115
00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:48.437
Then you can change it to
upper Roman numeral, and

116
00:07:48.437 --> 00:07:50.382
I think you can also do lower.

117
00:07:50.382 --> 00:07:51.985
And that also works as well, right,

118
00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:57.265
they're lower case instead of upper case.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But something you

119
00:07:57.265 --> 00:08:02.700
can do which just to show you how flexible
CSS is I can also do, I think, bullet?

120
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.411
Nope, not bullet, but

121
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:10.572
I know square will work.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I change this

122
00:08:10.572 --> 00:08:15.946
to squares, here's the problem, right,
this is an ordered list, right?

123
00:08:15.946 --> 00:08:20.385
An ordered list has to be in that order,
or it's considered not an ordered list,

124
00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:22.555
right, it would be an unordered list.

125
00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:26.394
But I can use CSS to style
exactly the same way.

126
00:08:26.394 --> 00:08:30.762
This is going to be a common theme
through our HTML and CSS for you,

127
00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:34.177
it's like you use and
abuse CSS as much as you want,

128
00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:38.483
you can play outside the system
as much as you want, but don't.

129
00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:41.853
The reason why you don't wanna do it
cuz you screw up screen readers and

130
00:08:41.853 --> 00:08:43.870
that like that is a huge problem.

131
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.218
So, you should learn how to and
then never do it, [LAUGH] that's what

132
00:08:48.218 --> 00:08:52.459
I'm trying to teach you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

133
00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:56.132
if something is in ordered list make sure
that it looks like an ordered list that's

134
00:08:56.132 --> 00:09:00.967
all what I'm trying to say.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

135
00:09:00.967 --> 00:09:05.742
here this is they're square
instead of the normal circle.

136
00:09:05.742 --> 00:09:07.473
If I remove this you'll see that they go

137
00:09:07.473 --> 00:09:12.094
back to being circles.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and

138
00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:15.075
then I made everything brown
by changing the li to brown.

139
00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:19.181
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then I have another h2

140
00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:26.223
at the end of the page.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions,

141
00:09:26.223 --> 00:09:32.050
about what you saw here?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

142
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.536
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There is a question from

143
00:09:33.536 --> 00:09:35.028
Chad about selectors.

144
00:09:35.028 --> 00:09:38.497
If you have two selectors,
like a div and h3, and

145
00:09:38.497 --> 00:09:43.373
you're trying to change the color in CSS,
where are the operations in

146
00:09:43.373 --> 00:09:48.495
terms of which one decides the color
of h3, if you have the h3 separate,

147
00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:51.641
but also within a div.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question and

148
00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:54.477
the entire next section talks about it,
so yeah,

149
00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:58.414
I'm glad that you're thinking about that,
it's a pain in the ass.

150
00:09:58.414 --> 00:10:05.771
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah

151
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:09.133
go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is it okay to,

152
00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:12.373
within a span, assign a class to them?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.

153
00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:13.893
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay

154
00:10:13.893 --> 00:10:14.828
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll be talking about

155
00:10:14.828 --> 00:10:16.134
fastens here in just a second as well.

156
00:10:16.134 --> 00:10:18.374
So I also like that you're
thinking about that.

157
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.741
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yes, on HTML,

158
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:24.402
we start out dock type, on CSS,

159
00:10:24.402 --> 00:10:28.023
do we have to start out a certain way?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm sorry,

160
00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:31.647
say it one more time?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: For CSS, do we have to start

161
00:10:31.647 --> 00:10:38.137
out with certain rules,
like on HTML we start out with Doctype and

162
00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:42.987
then we have space and
then we have HTML, on CSS,

163
00:10:42.987 --> 00:10:47.642
do we have to start out a certain way?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: She's asking about

164
00:10:47.642 --> 00:10:49.523
Boilerplate.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Boilerplate for

165
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.142
CSS.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I see what you're

166
00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:53.506
saying, no.

167
00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:57.808
There's no like ceremony or
rituals with CSS,

168
00:10:57.808 --> 00:11:05.026
this is what exactly your CSS style should
go like, it's just a bunch of rules.

169
00:11:05.026 --> 00:11:06.544
That does answer your question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

170
00:11:06.544 --> 00:11:09.065
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay cool, thank you.

171
00:11:09.065 --> 00:11:14.006
That's a good question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So with this HTML,

172
00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:16.901
this HTML does not have the ceremony,

173
00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:20.704
the ritual Boilerplate around it,
but it would.

174
00:11:20.704 --> 00:11:25.751
And if you actually inspect element and
go through it, you would see it.

175
00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.595
This guy Justice is awesome,

176
00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:32.926
he's from Nigeria.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: He

177
00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:36.565
can't wait to see what you unleash,
neither can I.
