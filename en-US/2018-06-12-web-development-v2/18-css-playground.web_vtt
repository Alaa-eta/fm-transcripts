WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I gave
you here this CodePen.

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.960
So CodePen is website that I just
kinda hold near and dear to my heart.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.413
I think most web developers do.

4
00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:11.033
It's kinda like the playground I gave
you but it's even more elaborate and

5
00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.350
has more things.

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.530
So what I would actually invite you to do
is click this Edit on CopePen right here.

7
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.040
It's gonna open this website for you.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.694
You can kinda just ignore the JS part
cuz we're not doing any JS right now.

9
00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:31.551
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
you can see here I did a bunch of HTML.

10
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:39.611
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So h1, h2, h1,
a bunch of CSS over here.

11
00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:44.211
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To effect that, and

12
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.999
then you can see down here is what
that actually ends up looking like.

13
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.114
So I would say just play with
it to your heart's content.

14
00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:56.796
And I'll kinda step through how these
things are working and, yeah, why.

15
00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:04.673
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this h1 right here,
first thing I want you to point out,

16
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:10.033
cuz there's an h1 here, and
then there's another one right there.

17
00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:12.139
And they have an h1 select right here.

18
00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:16.131
So it effects both of them no matter
where they are on the page, right?

19
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:20.129
Cuz it matches, anytime this is in h1,
then apply these things.

20
00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:21.239
Make sense?

21
00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:26.230
So that's why this one is
equally effected as this one.

22
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.930
Cuz they both match the rule.

23
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.565
So the rule can be matched multiple times,
okay?

24
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:35.840
Font family, this is a font, right?

25
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.700
So the font is how the font looks.

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.860
You can see that this font looks
different than this one, right?

27
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.360
They're using different fonts.

28
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.890
Font could also be called a typeset or
something like that.

29
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.753
Anyone confused by the word font?

30
00:01:54.363 --> 00:01:54.863
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

31
00:01:57.153 --> 00:02:00.787
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Color red,
font-size 50 pixels, quite large, and

32
00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.360
then text-align right.

33
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.706
So you can see here that it's
being pushed over to the right,

34
00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:07.187
that's the text-align right does.

35
00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:08.892
It says move this all the way
to the right side of the page.

36
00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:15.481
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then we go down to
the h2, where it says, this is the h2.

37
00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:19.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Font-family, Monaco.

38
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.770
Monaco is a monospaced font, and

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.022
all that means is that every
character has exactly the same width.

40
00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:34.035
Whereas if you look at this one, this i
is not nearly as wide as this h, right?

41
00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:36.090
The h is far wider.

42
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.710
Whereas Monaco, every one of
these is exactly the same width.

43
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.118
It's monospace, that's what that means.

44
00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:47.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The color is sea green.

45
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.121
You can see that's a nice tealish color.

46
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:55.610
Font size 40 pixels, you can see
it's slightly smaller than this one.

47
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.592
The border is 9 pixels dotted gray, so you
can see here they have dots on the side.

48
00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:01.652
There's also dashed.

49
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.985
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And there's also double,
I think is one, right.

50
00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:10.590
So there's a bunch of different kind
of border styles that you can use.

51
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.920
I'll be honest, I think really
the only one that I ever use is solid.

52
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.420
But just so you know they're out there.

53
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.595
There's a bunch of stuff out there.

54
00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:19.800
And then text-align center.

55
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.090
So a curious image you might be
noticing is like, well, I have this h2,

56
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.200
and the border goes all
the way to the edge, right?

57
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.730
That's because these h1's
will take the entire line.

58
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.254
Unless you tell them not to,
they take the entire line.

59
00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:41.140
We'll get to how to tell them
to not take the entire line.

60
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.420
But by default, divs take the whole line,
h1's through h6,

61
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.370
they all take the whole line,
paragraphs take the whole line.

62
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.870
That's just what they do.

63
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.809
Unless you, again, instruct them
otherwise which we'll get there.

64
00:03:56.922 --> 00:04:00.527
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, paragraphs,
so we go down to the paragraph.

65
00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:03.810
Font family Comic Sans,
everyone's favorite font, I would say.

66
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.978
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are the font families
standard from computer to computer

67
00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:15.744
whether you're on a Mac, or is it-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The answer to that question

68
00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:16.260
is yes and no.

69
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.290
As any good question should be answered,

70
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.100
there are a handful that
you can pretty well rely.

71
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.520
Every computer has Arial on it.

72
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.412
Every computer has Helvetica on it.

73
00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:30.921
Only Mac has San Fransisco on it,
for example.

74
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:34.467
So if your on Mac,
there's a thing called Font Book.

75
00:04:37.052 --> 00:04:43.524
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see on here,
these are the web fonts.

76
00:04:43.524 --> 00:04:46.573
I don't know what the equivalent
is on Windows for

77
00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:48.832
this but it happens to exist for Mac.

78
00:04:48.832 --> 00:04:51.140
Every computer has Times New Roman on it.

79
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.610
So there's certain things that
you can depend on being there.

80
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.640
Whereas I think Monaco,

81
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.620
I'm not sure you can depend on
that being on every computer.

82
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
what if you wanna use a font

83
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.190
that you're not guaranteed is
gonna be on somebody's computer?

84
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.269
Then how does that work?

85
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.786
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My first answer
to that question is don't.

86
00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:14.689
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

87
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I know, I'm a jerk, I know.

88
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.550
[LAUGH] My second answer to that
question is it is possible.

89
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.260
There's a thing called web fonts
where you can basically include fonts

90
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.950
from Google, usually.

91
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.632
Google has a thing where you can just
include their fonts on your page.

92
00:05:29.632 --> 00:05:31.150
But usually it's unnecessary.

93
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.710
Usually you can just say, well, you're
trying to use this super impact MS font.

94
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.710
Just use Helvetica and call it a day,
or something like that, right?

95
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.979
Usually, you can just switch
to something else and

96
00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.267
not really sacrifice too
much in the way of design.

97
00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:50.627
And the reason why I say that is those
fonts usually end up being several hundred

98
00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:54.326
kilobytes, which adds a lot of
page weight, which in my opinion,

99
00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:55.270
is not worth it.

100
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.724
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Tell that to the designer.

101
00:05:57.724 --> 00:05:59.555
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I know,
I've been telling them for years.

102
00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:01.858
[LAUGH] And
I will be telling them for years.

103
00:06:01.858 --> 00:06:03.826
[LAUGH] Does that answer your question?

104
00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:04.476
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yup.

105
00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:06.106
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, cool.

106
00:06:09.282 --> 00:06:13.295
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So a bunch of these
that I'm showing you are well,

107
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:15.880
Comic Sans on every computer.

108
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.400
Not that you should do anything in
Comic Sans, [LAUGH] but you can.

109
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.040
So that's why you can see here is that
font size 30 pixels, background black.

110
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.590
So that's why it's black and
then the color is white.

111
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.218
So that's why it's on there.

112
00:06:31.218 --> 00:06:34.377
And then you can see in here that
I have some spans in here, right?

113
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.346
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if you go down to span,

114
00:06:39.346 --> 00:06:44.289
you can see that I have
yellow underline and italic.

115
00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.257
And you can see just that text that
is inside the span is yellow and

116
00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:51.190
underlined and italic.

117
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.527
So that's what spans do,
they do specific blocks of text.

118
00:07:00.793 --> 00:07:02.223
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A div.

119
00:07:04.176 --> 00:07:06.431
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you can see here that I did color blue.

120
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:09.927
And then inside of the div, there's an h3.

121
00:07:09.927 --> 00:07:14.420
But the selector says div color blue,
that h3 is still blue.

122
00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:17.463
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I got that.

123
00:07:21.018 --> 00:07:24.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then if you go
down to the ol, you can see here,

124
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.595
there's a thing called list style.

125
00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:32.467
And there's several ways
of doing list styles.

126
00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:38.307
So in this case,
I'm doing Roman numeral numbering.

127
00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:41.255
But you can also do, well,
if I just get rid of it,

128
00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:45.274
it'll go back to being numbers,
cuz that's what it is by default.

129
00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:47.875
And then you can change it
to upper Roman numerals.

130
00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:51.657
And I think you can also do lower, and
that also works as well, right, and

131
00:07:51.657 --> 00:07:53.923
they're lower case instead of upper case.

132
00:07:56.173 --> 00:07:57.839
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But something you can do,

133
00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:02.700
which just to show you how flexible CSS
is, I can also do, I think, bullet.

134
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.066
Nope, not bullet, but I know square works.

135
00:08:09.792 --> 00:08:11.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it changes the squares.

136
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.013
Here's the problem, right,
this is an ordered list, right?

137
00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:20.802
An ordered list has to be in that order or
it's considered not an ordered list,

138
00:08:20.802 --> 00:08:21.320
right?

139
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.800
It would be an unordered list.

140
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.660
But I can use CSS to style
it exactly the same way.

141
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.210
This is going to be a common theme
throughout HTML and CSS for you.

142
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.000
You can use and
abuse CSS as much as you want.

143
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.483
You can play outside the system
as much as you want, but don't.

144
00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:42.392
The reason why you don't wanna do it
is cuz you screw up screen readers.

145
00:08:42.392 --> 00:08:43.870
And that is a huge problem.

146
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.535
So you should learn how to and
then never do it.

147
00:08:47.535 --> 00:08:50.013
[LAUGH] That's what I'm
trying to teach you.

148
00:08:52.373 --> 00:08:53.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if something is an ordered list,

149
00:08:53.864 --> 00:08:55.764
make sure that it looks
like an ordered list.

150
00:08:55.764 --> 00:08:57.496
That's all I'm trying to say.

151
00:09:00.814 --> 00:09:05.793
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here, this is
a square instead of the normal circle.

152
00:09:05.793 --> 00:09:08.572
If I remove this, you'll see that
they go back to being circles.

153
00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:13.772
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then I made everything brown by changing

154
00:09:13.772 --> 00:09:14.516
the li to brown.

155
00:09:17.548 --> 00:09:21.364
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then I have another
l2 or an h2 at the end of the page.

156
00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:28.305
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions
about what you saw here?

157
00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:32.258
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

158
00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:35.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: There's a question
from chat, about selectors.

159
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.004
If you have two selectors, a div and
an h3, and you're trying to

160
00:09:40.004 --> 00:09:45.006
change the color in CSS, what
are the operations in terms of which one

161
00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:50.206
decides the color of h3 for the h3,
separate, but also within a div?

162
00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:54.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a good question, and
the entire next section talks about it.

163
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.500
So yeah,
I'm glad that you're thinking about that.

164
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.435
It's a pain in the ass.

165
00:09:58.435 --> 00:10:06.270
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, go ahead.

166
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: And is it okay to,
within a span, assign a class to that?

167
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Okay.

168
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.961
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll be talking about
classes here in just a second as well.

169
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:16.588
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

170
00:10:16.588 --> 00:10:20.458
I also like that you're
thinking about that.

171
00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:21.677
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah.

172
00:10:21.677 --> 00:10:24.194
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah, so on HTML,
we start out with DOCTYPE.

173
00:10:24.194 --> 00:10:27.534
On CSS,
will we have to start out a certain way?

174
00:10:27.534 --> 00:10:29.032
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry,
say that one more time?

175
00:10:29.032 --> 00:10:35.213
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: For CSS, will we have
to start out with certain dos?

176
00:10:35.213 --> 00:10:39.401
Like on HTML, we start out with DOCTYPE,

177
00:10:39.401 --> 00:10:43.838
and then we have space and
then we have HTML.

178
00:10:43.838 --> 00:10:47.043
On CSS,
do we have to start out a certain way?

179
00:10:47.043 --> 00:10:48.302
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: She's
asking about boilerplate.

180
00:10:48.302 --> 00:10:50.384
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Boilerplate for CSS.

181
00:10:50.384 --> 00:10:51.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I see what you're saying.

182
00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:59.165
No, so there's no ceremony or
rituals with CSS.

183
00:10:59.165 --> 00:11:02.945
This is exactly what your CSS
style sheet will look like.

184
00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:05.066
It's just a bunch of rules.

185
00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:06.196
Does that answer your question?

186
00:11:06.196 --> 00:11:09.153
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, cool, thank you.

187
00:11:09.153 --> 00:11:10.247
That's a good question.

188
00:11:12.593 --> 00:11:16.973
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So with this HTML,
this HTML does not have the ceremony,

189
00:11:16.973 --> 00:11:20.819
the ritual boilerplate around it,
but it would.

190
00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:25.825
And if you actually inspect elements and
go through it, you would see it.

191
00:11:25.825 --> 00:11:28.515
This guy Justice is awesome,
he's from Nigeria.

192
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.801
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: He can't wait
to see what you unleash.
