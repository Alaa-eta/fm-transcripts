[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: I gave you here this CodePen. So CodePen is website that I just kinda hold near and dear to my heart. I think most web developers do. It's kinda like the playground I gave you but it's even more elaborate and has more things. So what I would actually invite you to do is click this Edit on CopePen right here.

[00:00:18]
It's gonna open this website for you. You can kinda just ignore the JS part cuz we're not doing any JS right now.
>> Brian Holt: And you can see here I did a bunch of HTML.
>> Brian Holt: So h1, h2, h1, a bunch of CSS over here.
>> Brian Holt: To effect that, and then you can see down here is what that actually ends up looking like.

[00:00:48]
So I would say just play with it to your heart's content. And I'll kinda step through how these things are working and, yeah, why.
>> Brian Holt: So this h1 right here, first thing I want you to point out, cuz there's an h1 here, and then there's another one right there.

[00:01:10]
And they have an h1 select right here. So it effects both of them no matter where they are on the page, right? Cuz it matches, anytime this is in h1, then apply these things. Make sense? So that's why this one is equally effected as this one. Cuz they both match the rule.

[00:01:29]
So the rule can be matched multiple times, okay? Font family, this is a font, right? So the font is how the font looks. You can see that this font looks different than this one, right? They're using different fonts. Font could also be called a typeset or something like that.

[00:01:49]
Anyone confused by the word font?
>> Brian Holt: Okay.
>> Brian Holt: Color red, font-size 50 pixels, quite large, and then text-align right. So you can see here that it's being pushed over to the right, that's the text-align right does. It says move this all the way to the right side of the page.

[00:02:12]

>> Brian Holt: Okay, then we go down to the h2, where it says, this is the h2.
>> Brian Holt: Font-family, Monaco. Monaco is a monospaced font, and all that means is that every character has exactly the same width. Whereas if you look at this one, this i is not nearly as wide as this h, right?

[00:02:34]
The h is far wider. Whereas Monaco, every one of these is exactly the same width. It's monospace, that's what that means.
>> Brian Holt: The color is sea green. You can see that's a nice tealish color. Font size 40 pixels, you can see it's slightly smaller than this one. The border is 9 pixels dotted gray, so you can see here they have dots on the side.

[00:02:59]
There's also dashed.
>> Brian Holt: And there's also double, I think is one, right. So there's a bunch of different kind of border styles that you can use. I'll be honest, I think really the only one that I ever use is solid. But just so you know they're out there.

[00:03:16]
There's a bunch of stuff out there. And then text-align center. So a curious image you might be noticing is like, well, I have this h2, and the border goes all the way to the edge, right? That's because these h1's will take the entire line. Unless you tell them not to, they take the entire line.

[00:03:37]
We'll get to how to tell them to not take the entire line. But by default, divs take the whole line, h1's through h6, they all take the whole line, paragraphs take the whole line. That's just what they do. Unless you, again, instruct them otherwise which we'll get there.

[00:03:56]

>> Brian Holt: Okay, paragraphs, so we go down to the paragraph. Font family Comic Sans, everyone's favorite font, I would say.
>> Speaker 2: Are the font families standard from computer to computer whether you're on a Mac, or is it-
>> Brian Holt: The answer to that question is yes and no. As any good question should be answered, there are a handful that you can pretty well rely.

[00:04:23]
Every computer has Arial on it. Every computer has Helvetica on it. Only Mac has San Fransisco on it, for example. So if your on Mac, there's a thing called Font Book.
>> Brian Holt: And you can see on here, these are the web fonts. I don't know what the equivalent is on Windows for this but it happens to exist for Mac.

[00:04:48]
Every computer has Times New Roman on it. So there's certain things that you can depend on being there. Whereas I think Monaco, I'm not sure you can depend on that being on every computer.
>> Speaker 3: So what if you wanna use a font that you're not guaranteed is gonna be on somebody's computer?

[00:05:06]
Then how does that work?
>> Brian Holt: My first answer to that question is don't. [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
>> Brian Holt: I know, I'm a jerk, I know. [LAUGH] My second answer to that question is it is possible. There's a thing called web fonts where you can basically include fonts from Google, usually.

[00:05:24]
Google has a thing where you can just include their fonts on your page. But usually it's unnecessary. Usually you can just say, well, you're trying to use this super impact MS font. Just use Helvetica and call it a day, or something like that, right? Usually, you can just switch to something else and not really sacrifice too much in the way of design.

[00:05:46]
And the reason why I say that is those fonts usually end up being several hundred kilobytes, which adds a lot of page weight, which in my opinion, is not worth it.
>> Speaker 4: Tell that to the designer.
>> Brian Holt: I know, I've been telling them for years. [LAUGH] And I will be telling them for years.

[00:06:01]
[LAUGH] Does that answer your question?
>> Speaker 4: Yup.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, cool.
>> Brian Holt: So a bunch of these that I'm showing you are well, Comic Sans on every computer. Not that you should do anything in Comic Sans, [LAUGH] but you can. So that's why you can see here is that font size 30 pixels, background black.

[00:06:26]
So that's why it's black and then the color is white. So that's why it's on there. And then you can see in here that I have some spans in here, right?
>> Brian Holt: And if you go down to span, you can see that I have yellow underline and italic.

[00:06:44]
And you can see just that text that is inside the span is yellow and underlined and italic. So that's what spans do, they do specific blocks of text.
>> Brian Holt: A div.
>> Brian Holt: So you can see here that I did color blue. And then inside of the div, there's an h3.

[00:07:09]
But the selector says div color blue, that h3 is still blue.
>> Brian Holt: So I got that.
>> Brian Holt: Then if you go down to the ol, you can see here, there's a thing called list style. And there's several ways of doing list styles. So in this case, I'm doing Roman numeral numbering.

[00:07:38]
But you can also do, well, if I just get rid of it, it'll go back to being numbers, cuz that's what it is by default. And then you can change it to upper Roman numerals. And I think you can also do lower, and that also works as well, right, and they're lower case instead of upper case.

[00:07:56]

>> Brian Holt: But something you can do, which just to show you how flexible CSS is, I can also do, I think, bullet. Nope, not bullet, but I know square works.
>> Brian Holt: So it changes the squares. Here's the problem, right, this is an ordered list, right? An ordered list has to be in that order or it's considered not an ordered list, right?

[00:08:21]
It would be an unordered list. But I can use CSS to style it exactly the same way. This is going to be a common theme throughout HTML and CSS for you. You can use and abuse CSS as much as you want. You can play outside the system as much as you want, but don't.

[00:08:38]
The reason why you don't wanna do it is cuz you screw up screen readers. And that is a huge problem. So you should learn how to and then never do it. [LAUGH] That's what I'm trying to teach you.
>> Brian Holt: So if something is an ordered list, make sure that it looks like an ordered list.

[00:08:55]
That's all I'm trying to say.
>> Brian Holt: So here, this is a square instead of the normal circle. If I remove this, you'll see that they go back to being circles.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, and then I made everything brown by changing the li to brown.
>> Brian Holt: And then I have another l2 or an h2 at the end of the page.

[00:09:24]

>> Brian Holt: Any questions about what you saw here?
>> Brian Holt: Yeah?
>> Speaker 5: There's a question from chat, about selectors. If you have two selectors, a div and an h3, and you're trying to change the color in CSS, what are the operations in terms of which one decides the color of h3 for the h3, separate, but also within a div?

[00:09:50]

>> Brian Holt: It's a good question, and the entire next section talks about it. So yeah, I'm glad that you're thinking about that. It's a pain in the ass. [LAUGH]
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, go ahead.
>> Speaker 6: And is it okay to, within a span, assign a class to that?
>> Brian Holt: Yes.
>> Speaker 6: Okay.

[00:10:14]

>> Brian Holt: And we'll be talking about classes here in just a second as well.
>> Speaker 6: Okay.
>> Brian Holt: So I also like that you're thinking about that.
>> Speaker 7: Yeah.
>> Speaker 7: Yeah, so on HTML, we start out with DOCTYPE. On CSS, will we have to start out a certain way?
>> Brian Holt: Sorry, say that one more time?

[00:10:29]

>> Speaker 7: For CSS, will we have to start out with certain dos? Like on HTML, we start out with DOCTYPE, and then we have space and then we have HTML. On CSS, do we have to start out a certain way?
>> Speaker 6: She's asking about boilerplate.
>> Speaker 2: Boilerplate for CSS.

[00:10:50]

>> Brian Holt: I see what you're saying. No, so there's no ceremony or rituals with CSS. This is exactly what your CSS style sheet will look like. It's just a bunch of rules. Does that answer your question?
>> Speaker 2: Yeah.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, cool, thank you. That's a good question.
>> Brian Holt: So with this HTML, this HTML does not have the ceremony, the ritual boilerplate around it, but it would.

[00:11:20]
And if you actually inspect elements and go through it, you would see it. This guy Justice is awesome, he's from Nigeria.
>> Brian Holt: He can't wait to see what you unleash.
