[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: I gave you here this Code Pen, so Code Pen is a web site that I just kinda hold near and dear to my heart. I think most web developers do. It's kinda like the playground they give you, but it's even more elaborate and has more things. So what I would actually invite you to do is click this edit on Code Pen right here.

[00:00:18]

>> Brian Holt: It's gonna open this website for you. You can kinda just ignore the JS part cuz we're not doing any JS right now.
>> Brian Holt: And you can see here I did a bunch of HTML.
>> Brian Holt: So h1, h2, h1, a bunch of CSS over here,
>> Brian Holt: To affect that.

[00:00:44]
And then you can see down here, it's like what that actually ends up looking like? So, I would say just like, play with it till your hearts content, and I'll kinda steps through of how these things are working, what they and yeah why.
>> Brian Holt: So, this h1 right here,

[00:01:04]

>> Brian Holt: First thing I want you to point out. Cuz there's an h1 here and there's another one right there, and I have an h1 select right here. So it affects both of them no matter where they are on the page, right? Cuz it matches like, anytime this is an h1, then apply these things, make sense?

[00:01:22]
So that's why this one is equally affected as this one. Cuz they both match the rule, cuz the rule can be matched multiple times, okay? Font family, this is a font right, so the font is how the font looks, you can see that this font looks different than this one, right, they're using different fonts.

[00:01:44]
Font could also be called a typeset, or something like that, is anyone confused by the word font?
>> Brian Holt: Okay.
>> Brian Holt: Color red, font size 50 pixels, quite large, and then text-align right. So you can see here that it's being pushed over to the right, that's what that text align right does.

[00:02:07]
It says move this all the way to the right side of the page.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, then we go down to the h2 where it says this is the h2.
>> Brian Holt: Font family, Monaco, Monaco is a monospaced font. And what all that means is that every character is exactly the same width.

[00:02:29]
Whereas you look this one, this i is not nearly as wide as this h, right, the h is far wider. Whereas Monaco, everyone of this is exactly the same width it's monospace, that's what that means.
>> Brian Holt: The color is sea green, you can see that's a nice tealish color.

[00:02:51]
Font size 40 pixels, you can see it's slightly smaller than this one. The border is 9 pixels dotted gray, so you can see here there are dots on the side, there's also dashed.
>> Brian Holt: And there's also double, I think is one. So there's a bunch of different kinda border styles that you can use.

[00:03:10]
I'll be honest, I think really the only one that I ever use is solid, but just you know they're out there, there's a bunch of stuff out there. And then text-align: center, so you're curious and you might be noticing it's like, well I have this h2 and the border goes all the way to the edge, right.

[00:03:28]
That's because these h1's will take the entire line, unless you tell them not to, they take the entire line. We'll get to how to tell them to not take the entire line, but by default divs take the whole line, h1s through h6 takes the whole line. Paragraphs take the whole line, that's just what they do.

[00:03:50]
Unless you, again, instruct them otherwise which we'll get there.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, paragraph, so we go under the paragraph, font-family: Comic Sans, everyone's favorite font I would say.
>> Speaker 2: Are the font family standard from computer to computer whether you're on a Mac or is it?
>> Brian Holt: The answer to that question is yes and no, as any good question should be answered.

[00:04:20]
There are a handful that you can pretty well rely, like every computer has Arial on it, every computer has Helvetica on it. Only Mac has San Francisco on it, for example, so if you're on a Mac, there's a thing called font book.
>> Brian Holt: And you can see on here, like these are the web fonts.

[00:04:41]
Like, if something, I don't know what the equivalent is on Windows for this but this happens to exist for Mac. Like every computer has Times New Roman on it, so there's certain things that you can depend on being there. There's, whereas like I think, Monaco, I'm not sure you can depend on tapping on every computer.

[00:04:59]

>> Speaker 2: So what if you wanna use a font that you're not guaranteed is gonna be on somebody's computer then, how does that work?
>> Brian Holt: My first answer to that question is don't [LAUGH] I know I'm a jerk. [LAUGH] My second answer to that question is it is possible, there is a thing called Web Fonts, where you can basically include fonts from Google usually.

[00:05:24]
Google has a thing where you can just include their fonts on their page, but usually it's unnecessary. Usually you can say, like well you're trying to use this like super impact, MS font, just use Helvetica and code today or something like that, right? Usually you can just switch to something out to not really sacrifice to which in way of design.

[00:05:45]
And the reason why is I say that is those fonts usually end up being several hundred kilobytes, which adds a lot of page weight, which in my opinion is not worth it.
>> Speaker 2: Tell that to the designer.
>> Brian Holt: I know, I've been telling them for years, [LAUGH] and I will be telling them for years.

[00:06:01]
[LAUGH] Does that answer your question? Okay, cool.
>> Brian Holt: So a bunch of these that I'm showing you are, well like Comic Sans on every computer, not that you should do anything in Comic Sans, [LAUGH] but you can. So that's why you can see here it's that font size 30 pixels, background black, so that's why it's black and then the color is white, that's why it's on there.

[00:06:31]
And then you can see in here that I have some spans in here, right?
>> Brian Holt: And if you go down to span, you can see that I have yellow underline in italic and you can see just that text that is inside the span is yellow and underlined and italic.

[00:06:53]
So that's what spans do, they do specific blocks of text.
>> Brian Holt: Div.
>> Brian Holt: So you can see here that I did color blue and then inside of the div there's an h3. But the selector says div color blue that h3 is still blue. So that's how I got that.

[00:07:20]

>> Brian Holt: Then if you go down to the ol.
>> Brian Holt: You can see here there is a thing called list style and there are several ways of doing list styles. So in this case I'm doing Roman numeral numbering. Roman numeral numbering, but you can also do, well, if I just get rid of it It will go back to being numbers cuz that's what it is by default.

[00:07:45]
Then you can change it to upper Roman numeral, and I think you can also do lower. And that also works as well, right, they're lower case instead of upper case.
>> Brian Holt: But something you can do which just to show you how flexible CSS is I can also do, I think, bullet?

[00:08:03]
Nope, not bullet, but I know square will work.
>> Brian Holt: So I change this to squares, here's the problem, right, this is an ordered list, right? An ordered list has to be in that order, or it's considered not an ordered list, right, it would be an unordered list. But I can use CSS to style exactly the same way.

[00:08:26]
This is going to be a common theme through our HTML and CSS for you, it's like you use and abuse CSS as much as you want, you can play outside the system as much as you want, but don't. The reason why you don't wanna do it cuz you screw up screen readers and that like that is a huge problem.

[00:08:43]
So, you should learn how to and then never do it, [LAUGH] that's what I'm trying to teach you.
>> Brian Holt: So if something is in ordered list make sure that it looks like an ordered list that's all what I'm trying to say.
>> Brian Holt: So here this is they're square instead of the normal circle.

[00:09:05]
If I remove this you'll see that they go back to being circles.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, and then I made everything brown by changing the li to brown.
>> Brian Holt: And then I have another h2 at the end of the page.
>> Brian Holt: Any questions, about what you saw here?
>> Brian Holt: Yeah?

[00:09:32]

>> Speaker 2: There is a question from Chad about selectors. If you have two selectors, like a div and h3, and you're trying to change the color in CSS, where are the operations in terms of which one decides the color of h3, if you have the h3 separate, but also within a div.

[00:09:50]

>> Brian Holt: That's a good question and the entire next section talks about it, so yeah, I'm glad that you're thinking about that, it's a pain in the ass. [LAUGH]
>> Brian Holt: Yeah go ahead.
>> Speaker 3: Is it okay to, within a span, assign a class to them?
>> Brian Holt: Yes.
>> Speaker 3: Okay

[00:10:13]

>> Brian Holt: And we'll be talking about fastens here in just a second as well. So I also like that you're thinking about that.
>> Speaker 4: Yes, on HTML, we start out dock type, on CSS, do we have to start out a certain way?
>> Brian Holt: I'm sorry, say it one more time?

[00:10:28]

>> Speaker 4: For CSS, do we have to start out with certain rules, like on HTML we start out with Doctype and then we have space and then we have HTML, on CSS, do we have to start out a certain way?
>> Speaker 3: She's asking about Boilerplate.
>> Speaker 2: Boilerplate for CSS.

[00:10:50]

>> Brian Holt: I see what you're saying, no. There's no like ceremony or rituals with CSS, this is what exactly your CSS style should go like, it's just a bunch of rules. That does answer your question?
>> Speaker 4: Yeah.
>> Brian Holt: Okay cool, thank you. That's a good question.
>> Brian Holt: So with this HTML, this HTML does not have the ceremony, the ritual Boilerplate around it, but it would.

[00:11:20]
And if you actually inspect element and go through it, you would see it. This guy Justice is awesome, he's from Nigeria.
>> Brian Holt: He can't wait to see what you unleash, neither can I.
