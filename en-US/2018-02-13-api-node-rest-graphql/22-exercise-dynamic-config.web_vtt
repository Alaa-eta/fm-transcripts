00:00:02.648 --> 00:00:06.411
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so I basically
showed you what needs to happen here, but

2
00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:10.370
in order for me to explain it,
I pretty much have to show you.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.640
There's no test associated with this, and

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.340
an exercise is really just
to create a configuration.

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.670
It doesn't even have to look like mine.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.000
You can create it however you want.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.345
I just want you to create
a configuration that has

8
00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:26.630
a default.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.360
it extends based off
environment variables.

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.240
So if you wanna look at mine,
again, I have a default here.

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.550
I'm requiring the one that has
the appropriate environment.

12
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.420
So if it's development or
dev, I'm requiring this file.

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.830
If it's testing or test,
I'm requiring this file.

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.250
And then I merge it.

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.110
So that's step one.

16
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.440
It's create your system for that.

17
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.030
You can piggy back my system,
that's totally fine.

18
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.620
Then the next thing is,
go replace those places that we saw.

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.340
So for instance, inside of index digest.

20
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.940
Replace this with your configuration.

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.306
So in my case it would
be something like this.

22
00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:11.865
I would import config here.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Config

23
00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:17.007
from,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Config, it's the index.

24
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:21.039
So all I got to do,
instead of putting 3000 I would put

25
00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.937
config.port,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Boom, and now whatever my

26
00:01:26.937 --> 00:01:31.040
configuration says the port is, depending
on my environment, it's gonna be that now.

27
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.100
Right, now also get rid of this.

28
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:42.477
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

29
00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:45.329
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So that's one place.

30
00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.499
Like I said, the other place you
would wanna do this is in DBJS.

31
00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.330
You don't wanna hard code.

32
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.280
Mine's already changed.

33
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.216
So yeah, you don't wanna hard code
that URL in, you just wanna do that.

34
00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:57.538
I would say for now,
you probably only want.

35
00:01:57.538 --> 00:01:59.220
There's probably only two
database zeros you'll have.

36
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.790
You'll have one for testing and
one for development.

37
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.540
You should make those separate that way,

38
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.391
because in testing the database
gets wiped out every time, right?

39
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.296
So if that's wiping out
your development database,

40
00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:09.640
you'll probably be aggravated
when you actually go to your app.

41
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.370
You'll be like,
where's the seed data that I put in there?

42
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.552
Well it got wiped out cuz
you used it in testing.

43
00:02:13.552 --> 00:02:17.716
So whenever you make these configuration
files, you can see right here,

44
00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:22.040
I have a different database for
testing than I do for development.

45
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.624
Development actually just
defaults to this one, right?

46
00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:29.544
The way my system works is,
if I don't pass anything on these files,

47
00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:33.406
it's totally fine because the index
has defaults for everything.

48
00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:37.382
So whatever is not there
it just won't overwrite it.

49
00:02:37.382 --> 00:02:40.894
So this is gonna be as naive,
as simple as you want,

50
00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:45.797
it does not matter as long as you have
the port, the database and then for

51
00:02:45.797 --> 00:02:50.826
extra credit, you can go ahead and
put in the auth jwt secret right here.

52
00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:53.466
So instead of hard coding
the secret that was right here,

53
00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:55.840
you're going to use
the configuration to do that.

54
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.080
That secret will probably be injected
with a environment variable.

55
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.850
And then for

56
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.270
super extra credit you can also have
your configuration disableAuth or not.

57
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.950
So like, I wanna run in dev mode,
and then for

58
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.635
dev mode I'm going to say, what is it?

59
00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:13.610
Let me go back to it.

60
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.490
For dev mode I'm gonna turn off auth so

61
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.100
I can not deal with logging
in a user every time.

62
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.110
So this one is called disableAuth.

63
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.580
So if I were to say disableAuth and
I go back to my config for

64
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.867
dev and I put disableAuth: true.

65
00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:37.130
And then now when I run my server
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool.

66
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.906
So I run my server, now I try to

67
00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:46.692
hit it 300/api/notes.

68
00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:51.071
It still break because I turn off but,
I think it's still looking for user, yeah.

69
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:52.591
So, I turned off auth,

70
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:57.190
but it's still doing all the middle
ware which is this one right here.

71
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.284
It's still doing this.

72
00:03:58.284 --> 00:04:00.841
This is undefined right here, so
it's still breaking right here.

73
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.913
So maybe I'll extend it
to also not do that,

74
00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:08.464
let's see.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we

75
00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:13.039
go.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's try it again,

76
00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.830
there we go.

77
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.970
Yeah, that was totally it.

78
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.860
So that's extra credit.

79
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.940
It's just to turn off authentication
if that configuration is there, so

80
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.980
you can see the power of this.

81
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.350
You can just come in like,
yeah, for testing,

82
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.920
you know, turn off authentication,
or for development turn it on.

83
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.560
Like, however you want to do it.

84
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.090
But yeah.

85
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.930
Make a system like that.

86
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.090
Doesn't have to be intricate,
doesn't have to be perfect.

87
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.900
I just want you to get in to the habit of
building your own configuration thing.

88
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.520
I'm gonna leave mine up.

89
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.730
This one's not gonna take too long.

90
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.596
Lets say it's 3:52 now, lets come back at.

91
00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:48.588
4:15, and we'll talk about
implementations that you might have done,

92
00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:53.963
any fallacies that you might have figured
out, or any other optimizations we could

93
00:04:53.963 --> 00:04:57.673
have done, and then we'll go from there.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you just do one,

94
00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:00.000
just hit dev js, or prod,
or something like that.

95
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.246
Just show us the example.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, sure.

96
00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:06.270
Prod nothing,
because I didn't do anything for prod.

97
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.012
Dev I just put in expire time for the JWT.

98
00:05:11.012 --> 00:05:14.410
I put in secrets, here's my JWT_SECRET.

99
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.240
And I disableAuth.

100
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.459
For testing I'll just add
a database URL list here.

101
00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:25.310
So basically if you wanna know how it
works in my system you create this

102
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.660
base config, right?

103
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.790
And every single file is
the same shape as base config,

104
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.290
minus the properties they
don't want to override.

105
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.160
So if my dev file,

106
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.550
all I want to do is override the port,
that's all it would have.

107
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.919
it would have a port, it wouldn't have
anything else because the way it merges

108
00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.251
this, it's this overrides this.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You

109
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:50.040
can also do a dynamic require.

110
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.870
Although I don’t recommend doing that,
you can totally do that.

111
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.960
So what’s one, should I leave this
one up or, I’ll leave this one up.

112
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.320
Actually, let me see if
I can split two of them.

113
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.059
That’d probably be better.

114
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.345
I'll split that one,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

115
00:06:07.345 --> 00:06:13.116
that one.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,

116
00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:15.326
okay, so let's come back at 4:15.
