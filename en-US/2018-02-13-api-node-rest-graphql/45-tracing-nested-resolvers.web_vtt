00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:06.929
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I promised that I was going
to walk through how GraphQL resolves

2
00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.620
different levels,
I forgot I was supposed to do that.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.450
So let's do that first,
I think that'll be very helpful.

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.745
Because I know when I first saw that, I
was just like, ooh, man, that is awesome,

5
00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:26.475
so let's start with that.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So many branches, okay,

6
00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:31.695
I've got to write all of that over again.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's start

7
00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:37.343
as a user.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Wait, there we go, okay,

8
00:00:37.343 --> 00:00:42.909
so user one more time.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Getting user,

9
00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.312
getting playlists.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

10
00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:54.758
then getting songs.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

11
00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:58.254
then on the song, test,

12
00:00:58.254 --> 00:01:02.761
String.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And,

13
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:07.521
down here, Song.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Test.

14
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.660
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Return test.

15
00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.507
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And, getting test.

16
00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:22.950
Okay, now we can try it.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,

17
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.626
so if we come back in GraphiQL,
and if we run this query again,

18
00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:30.100
I should just refresh to make
sure GraphiQL is up to date.

19
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.400
We can check the query of the song and
we should see test, also.

20
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.540
So now let's come down here and I'll say I
also want to get the test, if I run this,

21
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.810
everything looks good.

22
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.527
Then we can look at the logs, and we can
see right here, it's getting the user,

23
00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:45.150
then it was getting the playlist.

24
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.420
Then it was getting the songs and
then it was getting the test.

25
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.377
So let's undo all these queries and
see what keeps logging,

26
00:01:55.377 --> 00:01:59.380
so I'm going to get rid of test, and
now I'm going to run this again.

27
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.514
Notice it does not say getting tests,
we didn't ask for it, so

28
00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:03.770
it didn't try to get it.

29
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.626
Now we're going to get rid of songs,
let me refresh that.

30
00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:11.664
I'm going to get rid of songs,
notice it's not saying,

31
00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:14.960
getting songs, I didn't ask for it, right?

32
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.234
Kill that, and then if I get rid
of playlists, it's not asking for

33
00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:22.960
playlists, because I didn't ask for it.

34
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.697
It only resolves what you ask for,
and that's the power,

35
00:02:26.697 --> 00:02:29.840
that's the thing that
I wanted to show you.

36
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.619
So you have to create the resolvers
if someone asks for it, but

37
00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.230
you don't know if they will or not.

38
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.718
Which is why you want to have nested
resolvers versus putting everything in one

39
00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:39.670
flat resolver.

40
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.010
That gets every possible
combination of everything and

41
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.110
you would never know what
someone was asking for.

42
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.312
And if you did, you'd probably have a very
restrictive API that you probably wouldn't

43
00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:49.233
need GraphQL for.

44
00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:52.539
You should just use REST or something,
most likely, or just your own

45
00:02:52.539 --> 00:03:02.131
interpretation or whatever.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any questions on that,

46
00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:03.410
how that's working?

47
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.446
Or, I know some people, if you think like
me, you might be thinking like, well,

48
00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:07.197
how do I break that?

49
00:03:07.197 --> 00:03:10.650
Because that's how I learn,
I'm like, how do I break that?

50
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.980
Anybody thinking like that?

51
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.950
Like what are some questions around like,
what are the fallacies of that,

52
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.532
or anything like that?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Nope,

53
00:03:24.532 --> 00:03:26.750
all right, cool, okay.

54
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.340
So now back to the test, if you're on
lesson 14, go ahead, and write some.
