00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:05.966
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So yeah once you check that
out, let me go ahead and check out here.

2
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.390
You should have lesson one and
then if you take a look around here.

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.720
Let me make this a little bigger,
can never be too big.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.760
If we look inside of, first of all,
take a look around the app if you want.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.650
Obviously there's a lot of stuff
here that's going to be filled out.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.940
That way, we can progress through
the course at a reasonable pace here.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.330
But if you take a look inside of source,
index.js, you'll see some stuff here.

8
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.110
Basically, what we're doing here is, and
this is something I didn't do on V1,

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.760
is that we're gonna build
this up using Webpack.

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.650
I know people are thinking why don't
we use webpack on the server side?

11
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.496
Trust me,
we're gonna build this out with webpack.

12
00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:48.440
One that's gonna, everybody to use
the latest features, like imports and ES6

13
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.930
imports and all the latest and greatest
if you want a different version of node.

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.660
And two we get to use hot module reloading
on the server side, which is pretty cool.

15
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.270
Which is a way better process of the like
node mod which just refreshes the server

16
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.900
and doesn't keep state.

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.290
So this allows us to keep state in the
app, like if you have a cache something

18
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.050
like that, it'll just replace the module
at run time and then it's there.

19
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.810
So we're gonna use that.

20
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.760
So you're gonna ignore
all this stuff here,

21
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.530
we can talk more about how you set
up module hot reloading later,

22
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.263
but basically what you're gonna do,
your objective is in the index.js,

23
00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:26.140
this is where I wanna start my server.

24
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.180
So this app right here is
going to be the server.

25
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.790
This is going to be the express
app that I showed here.

26
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.160
This is the express app and
you can see I'm listed to it on port 3000.

27
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.080
Inside of here I wanna go ahead and
actually start that server.

28
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.300
This app is gonna be that express app,
so that's all I wanna do.

29
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.530
And then inside of server.js,
we actually need to make app something up,

30
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.260
right now it's just no.

31
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.610
It's literally nothing, so
we need to make it an express app.

32
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.070
So if you look at the example
that I have here you can see

33
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.810
how one might go about doing that, but
basically, app needs to be an express app.

34
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.089
Go ahead and set up a hello world
route on index that does something, so

35
00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:12.347
you can at least check it out.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

36
00:02:12.347 --> 00:02:16.104
then you need to go ahead and
listen to that server inside of index,

37
00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:20.490
somewhere here, whatever port you want,
whatever port you have open.

38
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.651
There's some ports you can't use, but

39
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:25.468
you'll figure it out if you type it in.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

40
00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:27.990
that's all this example is.

41
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.830
So what we're gonna do is,
what time is it now?

42
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.330
It is it's almost ten,
so let's save this one.

43
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.220
This one's not gonna take too long.

44
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.956
So let's come back at 10:15 and

45
00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:44.000
then we'll go over it.

46
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.955
Cool, I'll leave this up here.
