>> Scott Moss: I think this one does have tests associated with it, so let's run that. If you run the tests yarn test. Oops, I'm in the wrong branch. Let me check out. So this is less than three.
>> Scott Moss: Yeah, so I wrote some tests. Let's see. Yeah, so if you run the test on this, if you check out to this branch lesson three and you run the test, the test are gonna hang.

[00:00:28]
Just like the site hang when you wrote the code? As you see right now it's just, it's failing. It's hitting MOCHA's timeout limit in like ten seconds, and it's just failing, all right? So your objective is, to get this test to one, not only not hang. But, two, if you can get them to pass, that'd be great, too.

[00:00:46]
So try to do that. The command for that is mpm test or yarn test. You should be able to run those pretty easily. If you're running yarn you just do //watch and it'll watch the test. If you're running mpm you gotta do -- --watch. And then you can watch them.

[00:01:03]
It's pretty fast. The test had to compile on web pack, so it can take a minute, but it's still pretty fast. So I'm gonna go to the exact challenge of what we're doing. So basically, complete controllers on query.js, get the route API specs to pass, they are probably handing right now and ignore the model specs.

[00:01:25]
There is some other tests in here that are felling, that has to do with models. Ignore those. Don't even care about those.
