00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.558
Thank you all for being here today, it
really means a lot that people took time

2
00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:06.589
out of their lives to come see my talk,
which is really exciting.

3
00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.735
So I'm Emma Bostian,
I'm a software engineer at LogMeln,

4
00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:15.064
I am from upstate New York,
originally born and raised there.

5
00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:19.463
After I graduated from Santa college in
Albany, I moved down to Austin, Texas for

6
00:00:19.463 --> 00:00:23.352
three years when I worked at IBM on
a design team for the quantum computing

7
00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:27.794
site, which was super fun, and that was
kind of my first intro to design systems.

8
00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:31.172
But at LogMeIn I work on building
design systems as well, and so

9
00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:34.830
this is something I'm really excited
to be sharing with you today.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.575
I do a lot of miscellaneous things in my
spare time, like podcasting, blogging,

11
00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:41.235
all the things that everyone
is getting into right now, so

12
00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:44.025
if you wanna learn more,
you can go stalk me on the Internet.

13
00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:48.272
So what we're gonna talk about today?

14
00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:51.673
I am really looking forward to this,
it's a little bit of an experiment because

15
00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:55.380
we're gonna be building a system together,
but everyone's is gonna look a little bit

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.263
different by the end of this,
which is gonna be really neat to see.

17
00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:01.698
And I hope that you all will share
it in the chat maybe after this

18
00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:02.766
workshop is done.

19
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:06.171
So we're gonna start out learning about
design systems, like what they are,

20
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:08.299
why they're important,
and how to build them.

21
00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.112
Then I'm gonna teach you some design
foundations and I think as engineers this

22
00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:16.000
is really hard to learn design, I'm not
an expert, I am an engineer by nature.

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.208
But I think going over some color theory
and typography will be super fun.

24
00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:23.991
Once we get that foundational knowledge,
we're gonna switch into Figma,

25
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:27.786
which is design tool, we're actually
gonna design components together.

26
00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:31.544
We're gonna turn them into coded
components, we're gonna animate

27
00:01:31.544 --> 00:01:35.832
those components and then we'll document
them and publish that on natla phi.

28
00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:38.840
And then we'll just wrap up by
talking about some fun people and

29
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.101
tools in the industry that you can
reference for more information.

30
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.411
I do talk quickly, so if I'm too fast,
just raise your hand and

31
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.533
I will try to slow down, and
if you have any questions, I'm

32
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:52.859
gonna try to pause intermittently after
some of the sections and take questions.

33
00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.036
But if anything's unclear,
just stop me and we'll address it.

34
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:03.682
So today, we're gonna talk high-level
design systems, this is a new field, and

35
00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:08.268
it hasn't really been standardized in the
industry yet, so this is my take on how I

36
00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:12.605
would build a design system, but
it's not gonna go into the nitty gritties.

37
00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:16.581
So we're not gonna talk about how to
actually deploy, like a build process,

38
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:20.864
because a lot of companies have different
standards, different procedures, and

39
00:02:20.864 --> 00:02:24.434
it wouldn't make a ton of sense for
me to discuss those intricacies.

40
00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:27.362
But we will talk about how to
actually build components and

41
00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:29.165
design components and all of that.

42
00:02:31.393 --> 00:02:34.763
Just a couple of housekeeping things,
so I have a repository on GitHub,

43
00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:40.408
I just made this public,
let me bring that up here, You can go

44
00:02:40.408 --> 00:02:46.779
find it at emmabostian/fem-design-systems,
it is public now.

45
00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:53.415
My reading is very complete, and
[LAUGH] it links to the documentation.

46
00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:57.029
So I put together this website
which matches my slides because I'm

47
00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.720
super extra and had to do that, and
these are also my speaker notes.

48
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.869
So this is what I'm gonna be
looking at and reading through,

49
00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:07.757
and if you ever get lost feel free to
just jump in, I also have branches I've

50
00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:11.798
created on GitHub at the end of each of
these big sections that you can jump to.

51
00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:15.094
But we will be referencing this from time
to time just to grab some larger code

52
00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.581
snippets, so
I would just recommend keeping this open.

53
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:26.493
Okay so, Let's talk about design systems.

54
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.104
So the Internet was not originally
intended to host large scale social and

55
00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:34.945
enterprise applications,

56
00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:38.865
it was really created as a way
to share data across the world.

57
00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:43.270
And a lot of the terminology that we've
used and we've coined throughout time,

58
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.972
has as written printed books.

59
00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:49.030
So if we think about pagination,
bookmarking, web pages,

60
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.061
these all have references
to printed media.

61
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.688
But we don't develop web pages as
like full webpages anymore, and

62
00:03:55.688 --> 00:03:58.796
when we think about building
our sites in terms of pages,

63
00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:02.193
we kind of subconsciously throw
reusability out the window.

64
00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:04.694
So instead of thinking in terms of pages,

65
00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:07.701
we should start thinking
in terms of components.

66
00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:10.674
We're seeing a lot popular
JavaScript frameworks and libraries,

67
00:04:10.674 --> 00:04:11.827
already do this, right?

68
00:04:11.827 --> 00:04:13.385
Even native web components, so

69
00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:16.569
we really need to shift our mindset
to think of things modularly.

70
00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:20.161
So a design system is really going
to allow us to create this modular

71
00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:20.940
experience.
