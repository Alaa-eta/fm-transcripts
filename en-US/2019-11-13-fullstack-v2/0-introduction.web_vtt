1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.519
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Good day everyone.

2
00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:02.355
It's good to be here.

3
00:00:03.813 --> 00:00:06.216
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [SOUND] I
can smell the potential.

4
00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:13.112
We can smell, I don't know,
the bits, the bytes, the words.

5
00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.122
Let's figure out a word.

6
00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:15.679
I always forget.

7
00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.854
I got a CS degree and
I can't remember most of it.

8
00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:20.537
So that's okay.

9
00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:23.260
We're doing Full Stack for Front-End V2.

10
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.875
It's been a couple years since V1.

11
00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.840
And you're probably wondering,
what has changed on the server?

12
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.890
Not much.

13
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.080
That's what's great about the server.

14
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.670
The server won't let you down.

15
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.897
The server doesn't change.

16
00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:36.754
I have a server still
running from ten years ago.

17
00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:38.157
I update it, but that's it.

18
00:00:38.157 --> 00:00:39.670
I don't do anything else to it.

19
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.440
I bet we can't say the same thing about
your front-end app, not true at all.

20
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.040
I'm not bashing front-end, obviously,
cuz I do front-end as well.

21
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.196
But I'm saying full-stack
is where it's at.

22
00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.298
My name is Jem Young.

23
00:00:53.298 --> 00:00:55.155
I am a senior software
engineer at Netflix.

24
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.824
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: My wife is the creative one.

25
00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.925
So she edited this photo.

26
00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:04.374
That was my Halloween costume for
last year that I didn't get to wear.

27
00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:08.760
I'm hoping I get to wear this year,
we'll see, we'll see.

28
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.230
I one of the things I also do is I'm on
a podcast called Front End Happy Hour.

29
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.057
We've been doing it several years now.

30
00:01:15.057 --> 00:01:20.557
I do it with, well, he was my manager and
now he's just another guy at Netflix.

31
00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:22.619
Still a manager,
I just have a different manager.

32
00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.995
And we have drinks and
we talk about front end stuff.

33
00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:31.525
And mainly this, but for shorter
periods of time and with more alcohol.

34
00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.253
So it's pretty entertaining.

35
00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:38.740
If you want to see the slides today and
kinda keep up,

36
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.752
it's at jemyoung.com/fsfe,
that's full stack front-end.

37
00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:50.075
Last time I did front-end full stack and
it got really confusing, cuz even I mix it

38
00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:53.598
up, but full stack front-end,
you should be at the right place.

39
00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:56.959
If the slides are not black,
you're on the old slides somehow.

40
00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.793
I don't know how you got there.

41
00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:02.199
Today we're gonna cover a few parts.

42
00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:06.244
And day one,
we're gonna cover full stack, in quotes.

43
00:02:06.244 --> 00:02:09.270
We're gonna cover the command line,
would are shells?

44
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.350
How the Internet works.

45
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.216
One of my favorite questions.

46
00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.120
And then we're gonna cover VIM.

47
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.915
We're gonna take breaks from
time to time just because, well,

48
00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:19.240
we're gonna learn a lot of new information
and we're gonna load up on that.

49
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.551
And I don't wanna overload anybody.

50
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:21.964
So we'll take breaks from time to time.

51
00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:26.700
And if we're going too far, or
you need to catch up, just say, hey,

52
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.181
Jem, I need a break.

53
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.737
And we'll take five, that's okay.

54
00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:34.462
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: What is full stack?

55
00:02:34.462 --> 00:02:40.751
Anybody, anybody, anybody in the room,
you can just tell me what full stack is.

56
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:41.656
What's a full stack engineer?

57
00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:44.587
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No one at all.

58
00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:46.131
Some of you said you're
full stack engineers.

59
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.442
So, [LAUGH] yes?

60
00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:50.543
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, everything from
the client all the way up to the server.

61
00:02:50.543 --> 00:02:51.367
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

62
00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:52.308
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The data stores.

63
00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:56.441
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, I like that.

64
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:59.520
The thing about full stack
is it's very contentious.

65
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.984
There are people that are like it's not
possible to be full stack engineering,

66
00:03:01.984 --> 00:03:03.830
that's not even a real thing.

67
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.210
Obviously I disagree.

68
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.530
And mostly I disagree with Brian Holt
who is my friend and rival, bitter,

69
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.446
bitter rival.

70
00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:13.887
He [LAUGH] says this is
a fullstack developer.

71
00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:16.078
And honestly, I agree with him.

72
00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:20.724
I think it is almost impossible to
be good at every part of the stack.

73
00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:23.596
You can be good at the front-end, you can
be good at probably some of the back-end,

74
00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:25.740
you might be good at databases,
you might be good at security,

75
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.720
you might be good at performance tuning.

76
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.510
You might be amazing at 3D animations.

77
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.290
But it's really, really, really, really,
really hard to be amazing at all of them.

78
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.640
There's very few people
in the world that are.

79
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.448
So if there's parts you don't quite
understand and you're like, that's cool,

80
00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:44.189
but I don't really wanna dive
into it too much, that's okay.

81
00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.820
That's the way it should be.

82
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.086
Find the area that you're passionate
about and then kind of dig into that and

83
00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:50.372
become an expert at that end.

84
00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:55.365
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But when we say,
what is full stack,

85
00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:59.994
a lot of front end engineers especially,
they're like, well,

86
00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:03.883
there's a frontend,
there's a back end somewhere.

87
00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:06.818
And then it works together somehow.

88
00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:09.880
I don't know,
someone just made an API and I call it.

89
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.790
I've never really given a lot
of thought about how that works.

90
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.344
Or maybe you do a lot more backend work
and you're saying, well, I make these APIs

91
00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:21.708
and then the frontend calls it somehow and
it gets built and it comes together.

92
00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:24.331
I don't know,
it just comes together somehow.

93
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:26.788
And this is where I was a few years ago.

94
00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:27.300
I just thought,

95
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.470
well, I don't need to worry about
that because I'll never touch it.

96
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.540
And that's not quite true.

97
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.757
At some point your career, you're
gonna have to work on the backend, or

98
00:04:35.757 --> 00:04:37.813
you're gonna have to work in the terminal,
or

99
00:04:37.813 --> 00:04:40.947
you have to figure out how to SSH into
something and look at a database.

100
00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:44.453
You're gonna have to learn all these
things, and that's what this class is for.

101
00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:48.749
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
why is full stack such a hard definition?

102
00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:52.011
Well, because frontend is
hard enough to define.

103
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:54.275
So frontend, it could be a car.

104
00:04:54.275 --> 00:04:57.142
Cars have UIs,
some of them are written in JavaScript.

105
00:04:57.142 --> 00:04:58.548
It can be a TV.

106
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.045
Browsers, obviously.

107
00:05:00.045 --> 00:05:02.333
There's desktop apps, mobile devices.

108
00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:05.073
There's appliances like refrigerators and
things like that.

109
00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:09.252
And I'm just like skimming the surface of
what it means to be a frontend engineer.

110
00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:13.550
And a lot of times people say,
yeah, frontend's hard, but

111
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.880
interviewing for frontend is even harder.

112
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.520
And it is.

113
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.160
And why?

114
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.680
Because of all this.

115
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.495
Literally, frontend covers so
many different use cases which would be

116
00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:27.300
frontend, that it's really hard to nail
down exactly what a definition is.

117
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.858
And don't fret,
the backend is just as complicated too.

118
00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:32.565
You say, I work on the backend.

119
00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.597
What does that mean?

120
00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:36.095
You could be building APIs.

121
00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:37.731
You might be a data scientist.

122
00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:39.055
You might do security.

123
00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:40.622
You might do cyber liability.

124
00:05:40.622 --> 00:05:44.478
You might be some sort of database
engineer, database admin.

125
00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:46.509
Or you might just work on the platform.

126
00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.217
Or you could do embedded software.

127
00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:50.492
Or you can do a lot of things
that are considered backend.

128
00:05:50.492 --> 00:05:54.880
But again,
it doesn't really have a hard definition.

129
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.816
But we like to say frontend and
backend just to help differentiate people.

130
00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:02.752
So again, we're gonna learn
a lot of new things today.

131
00:06:02.752 --> 00:06:06.813
If something doesn't quite click with
you or doesn't stick, don't worry,

132
00:06:06.813 --> 00:06:08.789
we're covering so much stuff today.

133
00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.772
So again,
what is full stack at the end of the day?

134
00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:16.331
I like your definition,

135
00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:20.571
which is someone who can build
an application from start to finish.

136
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:22.731
Pretty simple, pretty straightforward.

137
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:27.110
It's someone that if I say I
wanna make the next Netflix,

138
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.669
I wanna make the next Facebook,
that person,

139
00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.435
I can give it to you and and
they will start and you'll finish.

140
00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:39.139
You'll come from this crazy idea
to all the way to the finish line.

141
00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.641
That means the server, the database,
all these things between security.

142
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:45.401
And if that sounds daunting,
it's because it is.

143
00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:50.904
[LAUGH] It's really, really, really
difficult to be good at all these things.

144
00:06:50.904 --> 00:06:51.444
But today,

145
00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:55.510
we're gonna learn all the skills needed to
just understand exactly what's happening.
